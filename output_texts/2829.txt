Mr.
Wyville
took
a
friendly
leave
of
good
-
natured
Officer
Lodge
,
and
returned
to
Liverpool
by
the
next
train
.
Arrived
there
,
he
did
not
proceed
straight
to
his
hotel
,
but
drove
to
the
city
penitentiary
,
where
he
repeated
his
inquiries
about
Harriet
Draper
,
but
he
only
learned
that
she
had
been
discharged
eight
months
before
.
Neither
police
nor
prison
books
could
give
him
further
information
:
Disappointed
and
saddened
,
next
day
he
returned
to
London
.
MR
.
HAGGETT
.
SISTER
CECILIA
visited
Alice
Walmsley
every
day
for
several
weeks
,
until
the
happy
change
in
the
latter's
life
had
grown
out
of
its
strangeness
.
Their
intercourse
had
become
a
close
and
silent
communion
.
For
the
first
month
or
so
the
kind
and
wise
little
nun
had
conversed
on
anything
that
chanced
for
a
topic
;
but
afterwards
they
developed
the
silent
system
--
and
it
was
the
better
of
the
two
.
Sister
Cecilia
used
to
enter
with
a
cheery
smile
,
which
Alice
returned
.
Then
Sister
Cecilia
would
throw
crumbs
on
the
sill
for
the
sparrows
,
Alice
watching
her
,
still
smiling
.
Then
the
little
Sister
would
seat
herself
on
the
pallet
and
take
out
her
rosary
,
and
smilingly
shake
her
finger
at
Alice
,
as
if
to
say
-
-
"
Now
,
Alice
,
be
a
good
girl
,
and
don't
disturb
me
.
"
"
And
Alice
,
made
happy
by
the
sweet
companionship
,
would
settle
to
her
sewing
,
hearing
the
birds
twitter
and
chirp
,
and
seeing
the
golden
sunlight
pour
through
the
bars
into
her
cell
.
Sister
Cecilia
had
a
great
many
prayers
to
say
every
day
,
and
she
made
a
rule
of
saying
the
whole
of
them
in
Alice's
cell
The
change
in
Alice's
life
became
known
to
all
the
officials
in
the
prison
,
and
a
general
interest
was
awakened
in
the
visits
of
the
good
Sister
,
to
her
cell
.
From
the
governor
down
to
the
lowest
female
warder
,
the
incident
Was
a
source
of
pleasure
,
and
a
subject
of
everyday
comment
.
But
there
was
one
official
who
beheld
all
this
with
displeasure
and
daily
increasing
distrust
.
This
was
Mr.
Haggett
,
the
Scripture
-
re
e
-
reader
of
the
prison
.
Into
the
hands
of
Mr.
Haggett
had
been
given
the
spiritual
welfare
of
all
the
convicts
in
Millbank
of
every
creed
Christian
,
Turk
,
and
Jew
.
It
was
a
heavy
responsibility
;
but
Mr.
Haggett
felt
himself
equal
to
the
task
.
It
would
be
wrong
to
lay
blame
for
the
choice
of
such
a
teacher
on
any
particular
creed
.
He
had
been
selected
and
appointed
by
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
,
whose
special
views
of
religious
influence
he
was
to
carry
out
.
Mr.
Haggett
was
a
tall
man
,
with
a
highly
respectable
air
.
He
had
whiskers
brushed
outward
till
they
stood
from
his
lank
cheeks
like
paint
-
brushes
;
and
he
wore
a
long
square
-
cut
brown
coat
.
He
had
an
air
of
formal
superiority
.
His
voice
was
cavernous
and
If
he
only
said
"
Good
-
morning
"
he
said
it
with
a
patronizing
smile
,
as
if
conscious
of
a
superior
moral
nature
;
and
his
voice
sounded
solemnly
deep
.
sonorous
.
One
would
have
known
him
in
the
street
as
a
man
up
the
of
immense
religious
weight
and
godly
assumption
,
by
the
very
compression
of
his
lips
.
These
were
his
strong
features
,
even
more
forcible
than
the
rigid
respectability
of
his
whiskers
,
or
the
grave
sanctity
of
his
voice
.
His
lips
were
not
exactly
.
y
coarse
or
thick
;
they
were
large
,
even
to
bagginess
.
His
mouth
was
wide
,
and
his
teeth
were
long
;
but
there
was
enough
lip
to
cover
i
whole
,
and
still
,
more
enough
left
to
fold
afterwards
into
consciously
pious
lines
around
the
mouth
.
When
Mr.
Haggett
was
praying
,
he
closed
his
eyes
,
and
in
a
solemnly
interview
with
the
Almighty
.
While
he
was
informing
God
,
with
,
full
play
,
every
reef
was
shaken
out
,
so
sonorous
key
began
a
personal
many
deep
"
Thou
knowests
,
"
his
lips
were
in
to
speak
.
But
when
Mr.
Haggett
was
instructing
a
prisoner
,
he
moved
only
the
smallest
portion
of
labial
tissue
that
could
serve
to
impress
the
unfortunate
with
his
own
unworthiness
and
Mr.
Haggett's
exalted
virtue
and
importance
.
Mr.
Haggett
visited
the
cells
for
four
hours
every
day
,
taking
regular
rounds
,
and
prayed
with
and
instructed
the
prisoners
.
He
never
sympathized
with
them
nor
pretended
to
,
and
,
of
course
,
he
never
had
their
confidence
--
except
the
sham
confidence
and
contrition
of
sortie
second
-
timers
,
who
wanted
a
recommendation
for
a
pardon
.
There
was
another
official
who
made
regular
rounds
,
with
about
the
same
intervals
of
time
as
Mr.
Haggett
.
This
was
[
...
]
the
searcher
and
fumigator-
Â·
--a
warder
who
searched
the
cells
for
concealed
implements
,
and
fumigated
with
some
chemical
the
crevices
and
joints
to
keep
them
wholesomely
clean
.
When
a
prisoner
had
a
visit
from
the
searcher
and
fumigator
,
he
knew
that
Mr.
Haggett
would
be
around
soon
.
The
sense
of
duty
in
the
two
officials
was
very
much
alike
under
the
surface
;
and
it
would
have
saved
expense
and
time
had
Mr.
Haggett
carried
,
besides
his
Bible
,
the
little
bellows
and
probe
of
the
fumigator
-
-
if
he
had
been
,
in
fact
,
the
searcher
and
fumigator
of
both
cells
and
souls
.
Mr.
Haggett
had
observed
,
with
horror
,
the
visits
of
the
Popish
&
nun
to
the
cell
of
a
prisoner
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
Protestant
.
Though
he
never
had
had
anything
to
say
to
Number
Four
,
and
never
had
prayed
with
her
for
