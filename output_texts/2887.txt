glare
of
terrific
intensity
.
They
felt
its
hot
breath
on
their
faces
as
if
it
panted
a
few
yards
away
.
Suddenly
when
they
had
ridden
about
two
miles
,
Mr.
Wyville
drew
rein
,
looked
fixedly
into
the
bush
,
and
then
dismounted
.
He
walked
straight
to
a
tall
tuad
-
tree
by
the
roadside
,
and
stooped
at
its
base
,
as
something
When
he
rose
and
came
back
,
he
had
in
his
hand
a
long
rusty
chain
,
with
a
lock
on
one
end
.
"
You
have
keen
sight
,
sir
,
"
said
Hamerton
,
astonished
.
if
searching
for
"
I
did
not
see
it
,
"
he
answered
quietly
;
"
I
knew
that
it
was
there
.
I
once
knew
a
man
to
be
chained
to
that
tree
.
'
He
tied
the
chain
on
his
horse's
neck
,
and
mounted
with
more
words
.
From
that
moment
he
seemed
to
have
only
one
thought
--
to
overtake
and
warn
those
in
front
.
Half
an
hour
later
,
they
drew
rein
where
the
roads
divided
,
one
swamp
.
The
travellers
were
not
yet
in
sight
.
"
Which
road
have
they
taken
?
"
asked
Hamerton
.
going
to
the
right
,
the
other
to
the
left
of
the
Ngarra
-
jil
had
leaped
from
his
horse
,
and
was
running
along
the
road
to
the
left
.
He
came
back
with
a
disappointed
air
,
and
struck
in
on
the
other
road
.
In
half
a
minute
he
stopped
,
and
cried
out
some
guttural
word
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
looked
at
Hamerton
,
and
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
.
He
rode
to
him
,
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
.
"
Take
the
other
road
with
Ngarra
-
jil
,
and
I
will
meet
you
at
the
farther
end
of
the
swamp
.
It
is
only
twelve
miles
,
and
I
know
this
bush
thoroughly
.
"
Hamerton
answered
only
with
an
indignant
glance
.
"
Do
not
delay
,
dear
friend
,
"
and
Wyville's
voice
was
broken
as
he
spoke
;
"
for
my
sake
,
and
for
those
whose
rights
are
in
your
hands
,
do
as
I
say
.
Take
that
road
,
and
ride
on
till
we
meet
.
"
"
I
shall
not
do
it
,
"
said
Hamerton
,
firmly
,
and
striking
his
horse
.
"
Come
on
!
if
there
is
danger
,
I
must
face
it
with
you
'
His
horse
flew
wildly
forward
,
terrified
by
the
tremendous
light
of
the
conflagration
.
Wyville
soon
overtook
him
,
and
they
rode
abreast
,
the
faithful
bushman
a
horse's
length
behind
.
On
their
left
,
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
,
stretched
the
gloomy
swamp
,
at
this
season
a
deadly
slough
of
black
mud
,
with
shallow
pools
of
water
.
On
their
right
,
a
mile
off
,
the
conflagration
leaped
and
howled
and
crashed
its
falling
trees
,
as
i
if
furious
at
the
barrier
of
marsh
that
baulked
it
of
its
prey
.
The
bush
between
the
swamp
and
the
fire
was
brighter
than
day
,
and
the
horsemen
drove
ahead
in
the
white
glare
.
They
saw
the
road
for
miles
before
them
.
There
was
no
one
in
sight
.
Five
,
seven
,
nine
of
the
twelve
miles
of
swamp
were
passed
.
Still
the
road
ahead
was
clear
for
miles
,
and
still
no
travellers
As
they
neared
the
end
of
the
ride
,
a
portentous
change
.
came
over
the
aspect
of
the
fire
.
Heretofore
it
had
burned
high
among
the
gum
-
trees
,
its
red
tongues
licking
the
upper
air
.
There
was
literally
a
wall
of
fire
along
the
farther
side
of
the
salt
marsh
.
Now
,
the
tree
-
tops
grew
dark
,
while
the
flame
leaped
along
the
ground
,
and
raced
like
a
wild
thing
straight
towards
the
swamp
.
"
The
fire
has
leaped
the
marsh
!
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
The
whole
air
and
earth
seemed
instantly
to
swarm
with
fear
and
horror
.
Flocks
of
parrots
and
smaller
birds
whirled
screaming
,
striking
blindly
against
the
horsemen
as
they
flew
.
With
thunderous
leaps
,
herds
of
kangaroo
plunged
I
across
the
road
,
and
dashed
into
the
deadly
alternative
of
the
swamp
.
The
earth
was
alive
with
insect
and
reptile
life
,
fleeing
instinctively
from
the
fiery
death
.
Great
snakes
,
with
upraised
heads
,
held
their
way
,
hissing
in
terror
,
towards
the
water
,
while
timid
bandicoot
and
wallaby
leaped
over
their
mortal
enemies
in
the
horrid
panic
.
The
horses
quivered
with
terror
,
and
tried
to
dash
wildly
in
the
direction
of
the
swamp
.
"
Hold
on
,
for
your
life
!
"
shouted
Wyville
to
Hamerton
.
"
Do
not
leave
the
road
.
"
As
they
spurred
onward
,
their
eyes
on
the
advancing
fire
,
their
hearts
stood
still
one
moment
at
a
piercing
sound
from
their
rear
.
It
was
a
woman's
shriek
:
the
agonized
cry
reached
them
above
all
the
horror
of
the
fire
.
Hamerton
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
but
he
saw
Mr.
Wyville
rein
up
,
and
he
did
so
also
.
They
looked
back
,
and
a
mile
behind
saw
the
two
unfortunates
they
had
come
to
warn
.
They
had
strayed
from
the
road
,
and
the
riders
had
passed
them
.
The
fire
had
now
closed
in
behind
them
,
and
was
driving
them
forward
with
appalling
fury
"
For
God's
sake
,
ride
on
!
"
shouted
Mr.
Wyville
to
Hamerton
,
his
voice
barely
heard
in
the
savage
.
conflagration
.
"
And
you
?
"
cried
the
other
,
with
a
knitted
brow
.
roar
of
the
"
I
am
going
back
for
these
-
-
I
must
go
back
.
God
bless
you
!
"
