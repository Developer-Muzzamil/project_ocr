and

The
Houguemont
had
taken
on
board
her
terrible
cargo
.
From
early
dawn
the
chains
had
been
marching
down
the
steep
hill
from
Portland
Prison
,
and
passing
on
tugs
to
her
deck
where
the
convict
officers
unlocked
their
chains
,
called
their
rolls
,
and
sent
them
below

their
berths

the
female

had
come

fifty
in

in

chains

As

,
there
were

At

their
chains
were
unlocked
,

the

handed
to

Towards

end

of
the
chains
stood
a
prisoner
with
a
white
face
and
a
strangely
calm
air
.
She
did
not
stare
around
in
the
dazed
way
of
her
unfortunate
sisters
;
but
remained
on
the
spot
where
they
bade
her
stand
,
motionless
.
She
only
turned
her
head
once
,
with
a
smile
of
silent
comfort
to
some
unhappy

who
had
made
the
hysterical
sound

near
When
the
key
came
to
her
link
of
the
chain
and
unlocked
it
,
and
she
stood
unshackled
,
another
warder
thrust
into
her
band
a
card
,
and
pushed
her
towards
the
hatch
.
She
tottered
beneath
the
rough
and
needless
force
,
and
would
have
fallen
down
the
open
hatchway
,
had
she
not
caught
at
a
swinging
rope
,
and
saved
herself
.
As
she
recovered
,
she
gave
a
kind
of
pitiful
short
cry
or
moan
,
and
looked
round
bewildered
,
the
tears
springing
to
her
eyes
.
The
rough
and
busy
warder
again
approached
her
,
and
she
shrank
aside
in
terror
.
At
this
moment
she
felt
a
soft
hand
take
her
own
,
and
hold
it
tightly
.
The
touch
restored
her
confidence
.
She
turned
and
met
the
sweet
face
and
kindly
smile
of
Sister
Cecilia
.
The
warder
at
the
same
moment
respectfully
saluted
the
nun
.
"
This
is
my
hospital
assistant
,
warder
,
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
still
holding
Alice's
hand
.
"
She
is
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
my
an
room

the
warder
"
All
right
,
ma'am
,
"
said
the
warder
,
who
,
in
reality
,
was
not
harsh
,
but
only
rude
and
hurried
in
manner
;
"

she
shouted
to

next
on
the
chain
,
"

you

!
"
And
as
Alice
stood
aside
with
a
great
.
sense
of
relief
and
thankfulness
,
and
with
swimming
eyes
,
whispered
to
Sister
Cecilia
:
"
I'm
glad
she's
not
going
among'em
--
we're
all
glad
on
it
.
"
Sister
Cecilia
,
holding
Alice's
hand
,
led
her
along
a
narrow
boarded
ways
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
door
opening
,
into
a
pleasant
room
,
one
side
of
which
was
covered
with
a
large
medicine
case
,
and
off
which
lay
two
bright
little
sleeping
rooms
.
.
When
the
door
was
closed
,
Sister
Cecilia
took
Alice's
white
face
between
her
hands
with
hearty
force
,
and
kissed
her
.
"
Thank
God
,

child
!
"
"
she
cried
,
"
you
are
safe
at
last
!

could
not
speak
;
but
she
controlled
herself
,
and
kept
from
sobbing
.
She
looked
around

Alice
Walmsley
did
not

in
words
--
her
heart
overflowed
;

to

was

to

than
