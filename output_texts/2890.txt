then
one
of
a
gang
of
burglar
,
whose
chief
lay
it
was
to
mark
empty
houses
,
when
the
owners
were
away
,
you
see
.
We
weren't
doing
much
in
the
more
desperate
line
then
,
as
this
paid
us
better
,
especially
in
the
swell
night
only
in
a
house
in
one
was
to
be
left
in
the
ups
to
make
parts
.
It
was
a
dark
night
,
and
me
and
a
pal
had
to
go
on
to
some
plate
left
for
one

house
,
and
it
were
him
what
blew
the
thing
to
us
on
promise
of
half
the
metal
when
melted
.
He
was
to
leave
the
scullery
window
open
,
and
when
we
had
got
in
,
we
was
to
knock
him
about
a
bit
and
tie
him
the
thing
look
square
.
Howsomever
,
when
we
gets
to
the
corner
of
the
street
,
we
meets
him
skulking
about
for
us
,
and
we
l'arnt
that
,
during
the
day
,
the
plate
had
been
removed
,
and
so
there
warn't
no
go
.
As
we
talked
this
bilk
over
,
we
heard
the
tramp
of
a
policeman
t'other
side
of
the
street
,
and
my
pal
and
the
footman
naterally
cut
their
lucky
.
Being
in
the
shadow
,
I
knew
he
would
not
see
me
,
so
I
stood
balt
up
against
the
wall
,
and
he
passed
on
,
in
course
,
without
noticing
o
'
me
.
While
I
waited
for
him
to
get
a
safe
distance
off
.
I
saw
a
light
in
the
second
-
floor
window
of
the
house
exactly
opposite
me
.

What
possessed
me
I
don't
know
,
but
even
after
the
copper
were
out
of
hearing
,
I
stood
watching
that
'
ere
light
.
It
struck
me
that
there
were
something
wrong
up
t
there
;
what
for
I
don't
know
,
for
it
warn't
partic'lar
late
.
I
ain't
superstitious
as
a
rule
,
but
a
sort
of
a
kind
O
'
creepiness
come
over
me
that
something
would
happen
in
that
house
,
if
I
waited
,
and
something
did
happen
for
true
.
I
hadn't
been
there
above
five
minutes
,
and
was
jist
a
making
up
o²
my
mind
to
step
it
,
when
I
I
see
a
hand
pull
the
window
open
,
and
I
skipped
back
into
the
shadow
and
squeezed
myself
up
against
the
wall
.
Soon
I
see
a
man
put
!
his
head
and
shoulders
cautiously
out
and
look
carefully
up
and
down
.
There
warn't
a
soul
about
but
me
,
and
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
,
and
presently
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
little
balcony
,
and
listened
again
.
I
saw
him
plainly
then
,
though
he
couldn't
see
me
,
and
by
the
awful
scared
look
on
his
face
I
could
,
I
guess
something
was
queer
.
·
He
looked
jist
wild
-
like
;
pale
a
ghost
,
and
an
awful
look
in
his
big
black
He
was
dressed
like
a
swell
,
but
his
collar
was
torn
open
,
and
his
bit
of
white
tie
hanging
eyes
as
a
down
.
After
he
had
stood
there
listening
for
a
minute
or
two
,
he
stepped
back
into
the
room
,
leaving
of
the

I
waited
,
holding

open
and
another
swell
with
him
.
breath
,
and
crouching
down
in
the
dark
still
.
He
was
back
in
a
moment
,
"
I
could
not
see
this
gentleman
so
well
as
him
,
as
afore
coming
out
again
he
had
lowered
the
lamp
,
but
I
could
see
they
was
both
of
a
height
,
and
about
the
same
build
.
They
whispered
together
for
a
bit
,
then
one
climbed
over
the
balcony
and
dropped
into
the
flower
-
beds
below
.
The
rails
wasn't
high
,
and
the
ground
was
soft
with
rain
,
so
it
wasn't
no
hard
job
,
and
in
a
moment
the
other
was
down
,
too
.
They
opened
the
gate
and
turned
down
the
street
,
walking
very
fast
;
but
as
they
passed
under
the
street
lamp
opposite
me
,
I
could
see
them
plain
.
Lord
!
how
scared
they
looked
,
both
as
pale
as
whitewash
,
and
one
so
as
if
he
couldn't
scarcely
walk
.
They
was
both
much
alike
,
tall
and
dark

and
hurried
him
round
the
corner
,

"
While
I
were
hesitating
whether
to
follow
them
or
not
,
I
noticed
as
how
they
hadn't
shut
the
window
,
and
I
see
as
how
it
was
easy
to
get
up
,
by
stepping
.
y
on
the
first
-
floor
window

,
and
swinging
up
by

.
In
a
jiffy
I
had
screwed
up
my
thinker
to
get
into
that
room
,
and
I
did
.
What
I
see
,
though
I
had
expected

of
the
sort
,
almost
took
my
I
breath
away
Stretched
on
the
floor
in
the
far
.
some
corner
was
a
man
whom
I
took
for
corpsed
,
for
he
was
lying
quite
still
,
and
I
could
see
a
drop
or
two
of
dark
red
blood
streaming
down
his
temple
,
and
staining
his
hair
,
which
was
a
light
colour
.
I
had
seen
many
a
stiff
-
un
afore
,
but
coming
on
him
so
suddent
-
like
,
clean
took
my
nerve
away
,
and
I
had
half
a
mind
to
cut
out
again
quicker'n
I'd
come
;
but
then
thought
as
how
,
as
I'd
run
the
risk
,
I
might

on
some
goods

on
the
chimbley
piece
,
I
stepped
up
to
it
and
stuffed
them
into
my
pocket
.
The
room
was
richly
furnished
,
and
as
I
heerd
no
sound
in
the
house
,
I
opened
a
cupboard
,
too
,
and
'
found
a
silver
cigar-
case
,
and
some
other
knickery

I
was

when
I
heard
a
noise
behind
me
,
and
,
turning
round
,
sees
the
man
whom
I
took
for
dead
,
on
his
feet
and
looking
round
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
,
until
his
eyes
rested
on
me
,
and
then
he
stared
at

him
up

me
,
and

scarce
at

,
I
jist

me
to
myself
,
and
I
leapt
for
the
window
,
but
he
was
in
front
of
it
and
caught
me
in
his
arms
,
and
in
a
moment
we
were
wrestling
together
.
I
was
rayther
weak
at
that
time
,
jist
getting
over
the
fever
,
and
he
were
a
big
,
strong
man
,
so
he
was
capping
the
best
of
it
,
and
there
was
nothing
for
it

to
use

life

I
got
it
out

no

and
as
he
snatched
at

,
I
dodged
him
,
and
brought
it

on
to

temple
