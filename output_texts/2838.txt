"
One
of
the
Committee
followed
with
his
finger
the
amazing
outline
,
after
Mr.
Wyville
had
spoken
.
There
was
deep
silence
for
a
time
,
followed
by
long
breaths
of
surprise
.
"
All
the
land
within
those
lines
is
your
-
-estate
?
"
diffidently
asked
one
Mr.
Wyville
gravely
bowed
.
"
Estate

said
one

of
the
country
gentlemen
.
of
the
lawyers
in
a
low
tone
,
when
he
had
summed
up
the
extent
in
square
miles
;
"
it
is

From
whom
did
you
purchase
this
land
?
"
asked
Sir
Joshua
,
but
in
an
altered
tone
.
"
From
the
Queen
!
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
impressive
face
.
"
Directly
from
Her
Majesty
?
"
"
I
received
my
y
deeds
through
the
Colonial
Office
,
"
answered
Mr.
Wyville
,
with
a
quiet
motion
of
the
hand
towards
Lord
Somers
.
The
Colonial
Secretary
,
seeing
the
eyes
of
all
present
turned
upon
him
,
bowed
to
the
Committee
in
corroboration
.
"
The
deeds
of
Mr.
Wyville's
estate
,
outlined
as
he
has
:
stated
,
passed
through
the
Colonial
Office
,
directly
from
Her
Majesty
the
Queen
,
"
said
Lord
Somers
,
in
a
a
formal
manner
.
The
Committee
sat
silent
for
several
moments
,
evidently
dazed
at
the
unexpected
issue
of
their
investigations
.
Mr.
Wyville
was
the
first
to
speak
.
"
I
ask
to
have
those
prison
records
corrected
,
and
at
once
,
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
,
"
he
said
slowly
.
"
It
must
not
stand
that
the
convict
of
whom
you
spoke
was
a
murderer
.
"
"
"
By
all
means
.
Have
the
records
corrected
immediately
,
"
said
the
Committee
,
who
began
to
look
askance
at
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
Mr.
Wyville
then
addressed
the
Committee
,
in
favour
of
the
new
and
humane
penal
bill
.
Whether
it
was
his
arguments
,
or
the
remembrance
of
his
princely
estate
,
that
worked
in
his
favour
,
certain
it
was
that
when
he
had
concluded
the
Committee
was
unanimously
in
his
favour
.
"
"
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
said
the
chairman
,
before
they
adjourned
,
"
we
are
.
one
mind
-
that
the
Bill
reported
by
the
of

Government
should
be
adopted
by
the
House
;
and
we
shall
so
report
.
Good
-
day
,
gentlemen
.
"
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
rapidly
withdrew
,
coldly
bowing
.
He
was
closely
followed
by
Haggett
.
Lord
Somers
,
Hamerton
,
and
Mr.
Wyville
were
speaking
together
,
while
Sheridan
,
who
was
attentively
the
maps
suddenly
startled
the
others
by
an
excited
exclamation
.
studying
"
Hello
!
"
said
Hamerton
,
"
has
Sir
Joshua
dropped
a
hornet
for
you
,
t
too
?
"
Mr.
Wyville
,
this
is
terrible
,
"
cried
Sheridan
,
strangely
moved
.
"
Those
lines
of
your
property
cover
every
acre
of
our
sandalwood
land
!
"
"
Ah
-
ha
!
"
ejaculated
Hamerton
.
"
I
thought
this
land
was
ours
,
"
continued
Sheridan
,
in
great
distress
of
mind
.
"
How
long
has
it
been
yours
?
"
"
Ten
years
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
Sheridan
sank
nerveless
into
a
seat
.
The
strong
frame
that
could
brave
and
bear
the
severest
strains
of
labour
and
care
,
was
subdued
in
one
instant
by
this
overwhelming
discovery
.
He
had
been
cutting
sandalwood
for
nine
years
on
company
this
man's
land
.
Every
farthing
he
had
made
for
his
and
himself
belonged
in
common
!
honesty
to
another
!
Mr.
Wyville
,
who
was
not
surprised
,
but
had
evidently
expected
this
moment
,
walked
over
to
Sheridan
,
and
laid
a
strong
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
expressing
more
!
kindness
and
affection
in
the
manly
force
and
silence
of
the
act
than
could
possibly
have
been
spoken
in
words
.
Sheridan
felt
the
impulse
precisely
as
it
was
meant
.
"
The
land
was
yours
,

"
Mr.
Wyville
said
,
after
a
pause
;
"
for
I
had
made
no
claim
.
I
knew
of
your
work
,
and
I
you
no
warning
.
According
to
the
law
of
the
colony
,
and
of
acted
right
.
"
Sheridan's
face
brightened
.
To
him
personally
his
success
had
brought
little
to
covet
;
but
he
was
sensitive
to
the
core
at
the
thought
of
trouble
and
great
loss
to
the
Company
,
caused
under
his
supervision
.
gave
"
We
return
to
Australia
together
,
Mr.
Sheridan
,
"
said
Wyville
,
holding
out
his
hand
;
"
and
I
think
,
somehow
,
we
shall
neither
of
us
leave
it
The
again
.
vigour
of
your
past
life
shall
be
as
nothing
to
that
which
the
future
shall
evoke
.
Shall
we
not
work
together
?
"
Swift
tears
of
pleasure
rushed
to
Sheridan's
eyes
at
the
earnest
and
unexpected
words
;
and
the
look
that
passed
between
the
two
men
as
t
they
clasped
hands
was
of
brief
but
beautiful
intensity
.
"
Well
,
Hamerton
?
"
asked
Lord
Somers
,
smiling
,
as
if
astonished
beyond
further
speech
.
"
Well
?
What
of
it
?
I
suppose
you
call
this
strange
,
"
said
Hamerton
.
