I

Their
lips
met
in
a
kiss
of
inexpressible
sweetness
and
unity-
--
in
a
joy
so
perfect
that
the
past
trembled
out
of
sight
and
disappeared
for
ever
.
While
yet
they
stood
beside
the
river
,
they
heard
a
footstep
near
them
.
Alice
started
with
alarm
,
and
drew
closer
to
her
protector
.
Next
moment
,
Mr.
Wyville
stood
beside
them
,
his
face
strangely
lighted
up
by
the
moonlight
.
He
was
silent
a
moment
.
Then
Sheridan
,
in
his
happiness
,
stretched
out
his
hand
as
to
a
close
friend
,
and
the
other
took
it
.
A
moment
after
,
he
took
Alice's
hand
,
and
stood
holding
both
.
"
God
send
happiness
to
you
!
"
he
said
,
his
voice
very
low
and
deeply
earnest
.
"
Your
past
sorrow
will
bring
a
golden
harvest
.
Believe
me
,
I
am
very
happy
in
your
happiness
.
"
"
They
did
not
answer
in
words
;
but
the
truth
of
his
friendship
was
clearer
to
their
hearts
than
the
bright
,
to
their
eyes
.

He
joined
the
hands
he
held
,
and
without
speaking
further
,
left
them
together
by
the
river
.
MR

WYVILLE
FACES
A
STORM
a

contained

large
cases
and
moon
In
the
peaceful
water
of
Fremantle
harbour
,
Mr.
Wyville's
yacht
had
lain
at
anchor
for
several
months
.
On
her
return
from
Adelaide
with
Mr.
Sheridan
,
she
had
taken
on
board
a
swathings
,
which
had
arrived
from
Europe
.
some
time
before
.
She
also
took
on
board
many
persons
of
both
sexes
,
mostly
mechanics
and
labourers
,
with
their
families
;
and
among
the
crowd
,
but
with
airs
of
trust
and
supervision
,
as
caretakers
or
stewards
,
were
Mr.
Haggett
and
Officer
Lodge
.
Their
friend
Ngarra
-
jil
had
come
on
board
to
bid
them
good
-
by
,
and
as
he
strode
about
the
deck
,
naked
,
except
his
fur
boka
hanging
from
the
shoulder
,
and
carrying
two
long
spears
in
his
hand
,
he
seemed
a
strange
acquaintance
for
two

prosaic
as
Mr.
Haggett
and
Ben
Lodge

persons
so
This
thought
,
indeed
,
occurred
to
both
of
them
with
renewed
strength
that
day
;
and
it
was
emphasized
by
the
remark
of
one
of
the
mechanics--
"
That
black
fellows
seems
to
know
you
pretty
well
,
"
addressed
to
Ben
Lodge
.
"
Yes
,
"
said
Ben
,
with
hesitation
,
and
a
glance
of
doubt
at
Ngarra
-
jil
,
"
we
knew
him
in
England
.
He
was
dressed
fine
there
.
"
"
Well
,
"
said
the
good
-
natured
mechanic
,
"
he's
the
same
man
still
as
he

'
Tisn't
clothes
as
we
ought
to
vally

in
our
friends
.
"
This
remark
brightened
Officer
Lodge's
face
,
and
his
hesitating
.
y
manner
towards
his
wild
friend
vanished
.
When
the
anchor
was
weighed
,
and
the
last
visitor
had
jumped
on
the
barges
to
go
o
ashare
,
there
were
no
warmer
farewells
spoken
than
those
of
Mr.
Haggett
and
Ben
Lodge
to
Ngarra
-

.
That
evening

"
"
You
have
built
extensively
on
your
own
land
there
,
I
believe
,
"
said
Mr.
Little
.
A
shadow
,
scarcely
perceptible
,
flitted
over
Mr.
Wyville's
face
,
but
his
voice
had
its
accustomed
tone
as
he
answered-
"
Yes
,
I
have
worked
out
an
old
fancy
as
to
the
site
and
plan
of
a
dwelling

house
.
But
the
building
was
not
for
myself
.
Mr.
Sheridan
has
bought
the
place
from
me
.

"
Bless
me
!

Mrs.
Little
,
in
a
disappointed
tone
;

of

and
gardeners

just
when
it
was
finished
!

It

Hamerton

she
was

for
a
home

"
I
,
too
,

The
lure
was
quite
successful
.
Mrs.
Little
ran
over
in
her
mind
all
the
pretty
places
she
knew
in
the
colony
,
and
instructed
Mr.
Hamerton
with
much
particularity
and
patience
.
The
further
conversation
of
the
evening
touched
no
matter
of
importance
to
the
persons
present
.
