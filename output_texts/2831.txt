"
Tell
this
man
to
begone
!
"
she
excitedly
demanded
.
"
Come
out
!
"
hissed
Mr.
Haggett
,
grimly
stretching
his
neck
towards
Sister
Cecilia
,
and
still
bending
his
lean
finger
like
a
hook
"
She
shall
not
go
out
!
"
cried
Alice
,
in
a
frenzy
.
It
seemed
to
her
as
if
they
were
tearing
something
dearer
than
life
from
her
.
She
dashed
the
hooked
hand
of
the
Biblereader
aside
,
bruising
it
against
the
iron
door
.
"
Warders
!
"
shouted
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
,
"
take
this
woman
to
the
refractory
cells
.
She
shall
remain
in
the
dark
till
she
obeys
the
rules
.
Take
her
away
!
"
The
warders
approached
Alice
,
who
now
stood
in
the
doorway
.
She
had
turned
her
agonized
face
as
she
felt
her
shoulder
,
and
her
breast
heaved
convulsively
.
Sister
Cecilia's
hand
laid
upon
!
As
the
warders
seized
her
arms
,
she
started
with
pitiful
alarm
,
and
shuddered
.
"
Stop
!
"
cried
a
deep
voice
,
resonant
with
command
.
Mr.
Wyville
had
spoken
.
"
Release
the
prisoner
!
"
Every
eye
was
turned
on
him
.
Even
Alice's
excitement
was
subdued
by
the
power
of
the
strange
interruption
.
The
Scripture
-
reader
was
the
first
to
come
to
words
.
He
addressed
the
governor
.
"
Who
is
this
,
who
countermands
the
order
of
the
Chief
Director
?
"
Before
the
governor
could
answer
,
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
spoke
.
"
This
is
insolence
,
sir
!
My
order
shall
be
obeyed
.
"
"
It
shall
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
calmly
,
and
walking
to
the
cell
door
.
"
By
what
authority
do
you
dare
interfere
?
"
demanded
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
.
"
By
this
!
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
handing
him
a
paper
.
The
enraged
Chief
Director
took
the
document
,
and
glanced
at
the
signature
.
"
Bah
!
"
he
shouted
.
"
This
Ministry
is
dead
.
This
is
waste
paper
.
Out
of
the
way
,
sir
!
"
"
Stay
!
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
taking
from
his
breast
a
small
case
,
from
which
he
drew
a
folded
paper
,
like
a
piece
of
vellum
,
which
he
handed
to
the
governor
of
the
prison
.
"
"
This
,
then
,
is
my
authority
.
"
The
prompt
old
major
took
the
paper
read
it
,
and
then
,
still
holding
it
before
him
,
raised
his
hat
as
if
in
military
salute
.
"
Your
authority
is
the
first
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
decisively
and
respectfully
,
to
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
I
demand
to
see
that
paper
!
"
cried
the
Chief
Director
.
The
governor
handed
it
to
him
,
and
he
read
it
through
,
his
rage
rapidly
changing
into
a
stare
of
blank
amazement
and
dismay
.
"
I
begs
you
to
forgive
me
,
sir
,
"
he
said
at
length
in
a
low
tone
.
"
It
would
have
been
for
the
benefit
of
discipline
,
however
,
had
I
known
of
this
before
.
"
"
That
is
true
,
sir
,
"
answered
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
and
had
there
been
time
for
explanation
,
you
right
before
I
had
used
it
.
"
should
have
known
.
my
"
You
have
shaken
my
official
authority
,
sir
,
"
said
Sir
Joshua
,
still
expostulatory
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
"
answered
Mr.
Wyville
;
"
but
another
moment's
delay
and
this
prisoner
might
have
been
driven
to
madness
.
Authority
:
&
must
not
forget
humanity
.
"
"
Authority
is
paramount
,
sir
,
"
humbly
responded
Sir
Joshua
,
handing
the
potent
paper
to
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
allow
me
to
take
my
leave
.
The
humiliated
Chief
Director
walked
quickly
from
the
corridor
.
Mr.
Wyville
turned
to
the
cell
,
and
met
the
brimming
eyes
of
the
prisoner
,
the
eloquent
gratitude
of
the
look
touching
him
to
the
heart
.
He
smiled
with
ineffable
kindness
,
and
with
an
almost
imperceptible
motion
of
the
hand
requested
Sister
Cecilia
to
remain
and
give
comfort
.
Mr.
Haggett
still
remained
in
the
entry
,
hungrily
watching
the
cell
.
Mr.
Wyville
passed
in
front
of
the
door
,
and
turning
,
looked
straight
in
his
face
.
The
discomfited
Scripture
reader
started
as
if
he
had
received
an
electric
shack
.
He
was
dismayed
at
the
power
of
this
strange
,
man
.
"
You
have
passed
this
door
with
your
prayers
for
five
years
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
;
"
you
will
please
to
continue
your
inattention
.
"
"
The
prisoner
is
not
a
Roman-
-
"
Haggett
began
,
with
shaken
tones
.
The
hand
of
the
soldierly
old
governor
fell
sharply
,
twice
,
on
his
shoulder
.
He
looked
round
.
The
governor's
finger
was
pointed
straight
down
the
passage
,
and
his
eye
sternly
ordered
Mr.
Haggett
in
the
same
direction
.
He
hitched
the
sacred
volume
under
his
arm
,
and
without
a
sound
followed
the
footsteps
of
Sir
Joshua
.
had
been
denied
a
sight
of
the
mysterious
document
;
but

heart

eyes
