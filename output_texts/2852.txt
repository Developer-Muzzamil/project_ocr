always
planned
his
conduct
,
even
his
words
,
beforehand
.
As
soon
as
the
appalling
interview
had
passed
,
and
he
found
himself
personally
unmolested
,
his
adroit
and
subtle
mind
began
weaving
the
warp
and
woof
of
a
devil's
plot
that
should
make
him
the
winner
in
this
contest
now
begun
.
He
looked
at
Wyville
,
who
stood
grazing
out
on
the
sea
,
and
asked
himself
,
"
Does
he
know
?
"
And
he
speedily
ran
over
the
signs
,
and
concluded
that
Mr.
Wyville
knew
nothing
of
his
relations
to
Sheridan
.
He
remembered
that
Wyville
had
called
him
to
be
introduced
to
Sheridan
,
and
he
had
noticed
the
surprised
exclamation
with
which
Wyville
had
observed
Sheridan's
extraordinary
conduct
.
The
midnight
eight
bells
sounded
,
and
the
mate
came
to
relieve
the
captain
from
his
watch
,
but
Draper
said
he
could
not
sleep
,
and
would
remain
on
deck
an
hour
longer
.
In
that
hour
,
he
was
alone

the
poop

Draper
,
looking
down
through

glass
y
-
room
,
saw
that
a
bright
light
was
burning
in
Sheridan's
room
.
As
he
looked
at
the
light
,
The
roof
of
the
dining
-
r
secretly
and
alone
,
a
desperate
hatred
burned
in
his
heart
like
poison
.
years
of
his
guilt
were
melted
down
into
that
one
hour
,
and
they
took
the
form
of
a
blighting
.
curse
.
Could
malediction
have
murdered
Sheridan
,
he
would
have
been
withered
to
death
by
the
baneful
light
of
Draper's
.
But
the
hatred
of
a
a
man
sa
eyes
naturally
evil
as
Draper
is
apt
to
turn
into
practical
injury
.
The
coward
who
hates
is
never
at
rest
;
he
will
either
malign
his
enemy
with
foul
words
in
secret
,
or
he
will
dig
a
pit
for
his
feet
.
It
is
only
manly
men
who
can
hate
and
hold
their
tongues
.
As
D
raper
paced
the
deck
,
towards
the
end
of
the
hour
,
his
tread
actually
became
stealthy
and
fearful
,
as
if
he
dreaded
lest
the
nature
of
his
thoughts
might
be
read
in
the
sound
of
his
steps
.
Slowly
and
carefully
he
turned
the
circumstances
over
in
his
mind
.
Wyville
certainly
did
not
know
of
his
relations
with
Sheridan
.
Sheridan
himself
had
evidently
been
surprised
at
the
meeting
.
Only
one
knew
:
none
else
had
.
knowing
.
That
one
must
be
silenced
,
or-
any
interest
in
--he
,
Draper
,
must
face
disgrace
.
Once
before
,
Sheridan
had
eluded
his
design
;
but
this
time
--
and
,
as
he
concluded
his
walk
and
plot
together
,
he
glared
at
the
light
in
Will
Sheridan's
room
,
like
a
serpent
in
the
outer
darkness
--
this
time
there
would
be
no
mistake
or
hesitation
on
his
part

THE
days
slipped
into

as
the

sailed
southward
down

highway
of

The

latitudes
surprised
and
delighted
those
who
had
only
known
the
moist
climate
of

stood
three
men
,
looking
up
at
Pica

These
three
,
from
the
day
of
the
ship's
sailing
,
had
been
drawn
together
by
inherent
attraction
;

they

was

severe
,
dressed
in

garments
;
the
next
was
a

man

mild
of
face

manner
,
clad
in
old

sailor's
blue
;
the
third
was
a
very
black
man
,
whose
hair
stood
upright
on
his
head
when
he
removed
his
immense
fur
cap
,
and
--
whose
body
from

to
feet
was

it
was

that
this
seemingly
discordant
trio

Mr.
Haggett
,
Officer
Lodge
and
Ngarra

,
had
developed
a
mutual
attraction
,
each
for
the

;
and
,
after
a
few
weeks
at

,
had
spent
almost
their

They
