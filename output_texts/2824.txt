officers
wore
woollen
slippers
,
they
could
observe
the
prisoners
without
being
heard
or
seen
.
At
this
opening
,
Alice
Walmsley
thought
,
the
governor
had
stopped
as
he
passed
,
and
had
looked
into
her
cell
.
It
was
not
unusual
.
A
few
minutes
later
she
paused
in
her
work
,
almost
impatiently
,
and
tried
to
put
away
from
her
an
unwelcome
thought
.
After
a
short
pause
she
renewed
her
sewing
,
working
rapidly
for
a
few
minutes
;
and
then
she
laid
the
coarse
cloth
aside
,
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
.
She
was
thinking
of
her
old
life
,
of
her
old
self
;
she
had
tried
to
escape
from
it
,
but
could
not
.
For
years
she
had
separated
the
past
and
the
present
,
until
she
had
actually
.
come
to
think
of
herself
.
as
two
beings
-
-
-one
,
who
had
been
happy
,
and
who
was
dead
;
the
other
,
living
but
separated
from
all
the
world
--
alone
,
with
neither
memories
nor
hopes
,
neither
past
nor
.
future
.
Yet
to
-
day
,
without
apparent
cause
,
the
two
selves
had
drawn
together
-
-
the
happy
Alice
had
come
beseechingly
to
the
unhappy
one
.
For
an
hour
she
remained
motionless
,
her
face
bowed
in
her
hands
.
Then
she
raised
her
head
,
but
she
did
not
renew
her
work
.
She
stood
up
,
and
walked
across
the
cell
,
and
re
-
crossed
it
,
in
the
rapid
way
of
restless
prisoners
;
but
on
the
second
passage
she
stood
still
,
with
a
bewildered
air
.
Her
eye
had
caught
a
gleam
of
bright
colour
in
the
opening
of
the
watch
-
grate
.
There
was
a
flower
in
her
cell
!
She
trembled
as
she
reached
her
hand
to
take
it
.
She
did
not
try
to
recover
her
dispassionate
calmness
.
She
took
it
in
her
hand
,
and
raised
it
to
her
lips
slowly
,
and
kissed
it
.
It
was
a
sweet
rosebud
,
with
two
young
leaves
.
She
had
not
seen
a
flower
nor
heard
a
bird
sing
since
she
left
her
own
little
garden
.
had
presence
,
This
tender
thing
had
stolen
inside
her
guard
.
Its
sweet
fragrance
,
before
she
knew
of
its
carried
her
mind
back
to
the
happy
days
of
her
girlhood
.
She
kept
the
flower
to
her
lips
,
kissing
it
.
She
fed
her
wistful
eyes
on
its
beauty
.
She
had
been
so
long
without
emotion
,
she
had
so
carefully
repressed
the
first
promptings
of
imagination
,
that
her
heart
had
become
thirsty
unto
death
for
s
some
lovely
or
lovable
thing
.
This
sweet
young
flower
took
for
her
all
forms
of
beauty
.
As
she
gazed
on
it
,
her
soul
drank
in
its
delicious
breath
,
like
a
soft
and
sensuous
music
;
its
perfect
colouring
filled
her
-
-
with
still
another
delight
;
its
youth
,
its
form
,
its
promise
,
the
rich
,
&
green
of
the
two
leaves
,
its
exquisite
completeness
,
made
a
very
symphony
for
the
desolate
heart
.
Two
hours
passed
,
and
still
she
fondled
the
precious
gift
.
She
had
not
once
came
into
her
cell
thought
of
how
the
flower
had
"
You
are
pleased
at
last
,
Number
Four
,
"
said
a
female
warder
,
who
had
been
looking
into
Alice's
cell
.
Number
Four
raised
her
eyes
from
the
flower
,
and
looked
silently
her
answer
.
For
the
first
time
in
five
years
the
warder
saw
that
her
eyes
were
flooded
with
tears
.
She
did
not
sen
any
more
that
day
--
and
,
strange
to
say
,
the
officers
took
no
heed
of
her
idleness
.
There
was
a
change
in
her
face
,
a
look
of
unrest
,
of
strangeness
,
of
timidity
.
When
first
she
looked
the
flower
,
a
well
had
burst
upon
in
her
heart
,
and
she
could
not
stop
its
flood
.
In
up
one
hour
it
had
swept
away
all
her
barriers
,
had
swamped
her
repression
,
had
driven
out
the
hopeless
and
defiant
second
self
,
and
had
carried
into
her
cell
the
wronged
,
unhappy
,
but
human
and
loving
heart
of
the
true
Alice
Walmsley
.
She
was
herself
.
She
feared
to
think
it
,
but
she
knew
it
must
be
so
.
When
the
warder
spoke
to
her
now
,
she
shrank
from
the
tone
.
Yesterday
,
it
would
have
passed
her
like
the
harsh
wind
,
unheeded
.
as
soon
as
the
lights
That
night
,
unlike
all
the
nights
of
her
imprisonment
,
she
did
not
lie
down
and
sleep
were
extinguished
.
With
the
little
flower
in
her
hand
,
she
sat
on
her
low
bedside
in
the
still
darkness
,
feeling
through
all
her
nature
the
returning
rush
of
her
young
life's
sympathy
with
the
world
.
The
touch
of
the
rosebud
in
her
hand
thrilled
her
with
tenderness
.
She
made
no
attempt
to
shut
out
the
crowding
memories
.
They
flooded
her
heart
,
and
she
drank
them
in
as
a
parched
field
drinks
the
drenching
rain
.

,
as
she
looked
through
the
bars
of
her
window

She
stood
her

bed
,
opened
the
window
,
and
looked
.
At
that
moment
her
heart
was
touched
with
a
loving
thought
of
her
dead
mother
.
Her
arms
rested
on
the
window
ledge
,
and
her
hands
were
raised
before
her
,
holding
between
them
the
little
flower
,
сер
as
she
might
have
held
a
peace
-

to
