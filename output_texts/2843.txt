"
You
will
be
no
nearer
to
your
republican
idea
when
this
is
done
,
"
said
Lord
Somers
,
at
length
;
'
"
sold
the
land
,
but
the
money
it
brings
has
not
been
earned
by
you
.
"
"
Quite
true
,
"
answered
Hamerton
.
"
Why
keep
it
,
then
?
"
you
"
I
shall
not
keep
it
.
"
"
Why
,
Hamerton
--
what
do
you
mean
?
?
What
will
,
you
do
with
it
?
"
will
have
"
I
shall
invest
it
in
schools
and
a
library
for
the
people
of
that
section
'
for
ever
'
as
the
lawyers
say
:
Mr.
Wyville
and
I
have
been
looking
at
the
matter
,
and
we
think
this
money
will
establish
a
school
with
three
technical
branches
--
chemistry
,
engineering
,
and
agriculture
.
"
"
And
you-
--will
you
teach
in
the
schools
for
a
living
?
"
"
Oh
no
,
I
am
going
to
Australia
.
"
"
To
Australia
!
"
said
Lord
Somers
and
Sheridan
in
a
breath
.
Then
Sheridan
asked--
"
Are
you
going
to
settle
there
?
"
"
Yes
;
I
"
I
am
I
am
tired
of
Europe
.
I
shall
never
return
here
.
"
glad
,
"
cried
Sheridan
,
starting
up
and
seizing
Hamerton's
hand
.
"
Australia
is
going
to
send
out
the
largest
-
hearted
men
that
ever
owned
the
earth
.
You
will
be
at
home
there
.
You
will
breathe
freely
in
its
splendid
air
.
Oh
,
I
am
proud
to
see
such
men
turn
by
nature
to
the
magnificent
South
!
"
on
Mr.
Wyville
had
approached
the
table
with
a
look
of
intense
pleasure
.
He
laid
his
hand
almost
caressingly
Will
Sheridan's
shoulder
.
As
they
were
placed
,
these
three
men
Wyville
,
Sheridan
,
and
Hamerton-
-
they
formed
a
remarkable
group
"
You
are
"
dangerous
company
'
said
Lord
Somers
,
looking
at
them
with
admiration
.
"
You
almost
tempt
me
to
follow
you
,
or
go
you
with
to
Australia
.
When
do
you
sail
?
"
"
Mr.
Sheridan
and
I
will
sail
on
the
convict
ship
in
three
weeks
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Mr.
Hamerton
will
take
steam
yacht
,
and
follow
when
he
has
settled
his
plans
--
perhaps
a
week
later
.
"
"
I
am
dumbfounded
,
"
said
Lord
Somers
.
"
I
cannot
speak
.
I
on
this
new
thing
.
I
only
foresee
that
I
shall
be
lonely
,
indeed
,
in
London
when
After
you
have
gone
.
some
further
conversation
on
this
point
,
Mr.
Wyville
changed
the
subject
.
"
You
have
engaged
a
captain
for
the
convict
ship
?
"
he
said
to
Lord
Somers
.
"
Yes
,
Captain
Rogers
,
late
of
the
P.
and
O.
Company's
service
.
"
"
You
were
not
aware
that
I
wished
to
engage
him
for
my
yacht
?
"
said
Wyville
.
"
No
,
I
should
be
.
to
take
him
from
you
!
sorry
a
service
are
not
easily
found
.
"
very
But
his
articles
are
signed
now
,
and
good
commanders
for
such
"
If
I
find
you
a
suitable
captain
,
and
guarantee
his
command
,
will
you
oblige
me
by
cancelling
Captain
Rogers's
commission
?
"
Certainly
--
if
you
give
him
,
instead
,
the
command
of
your
steamer
.
"
"
Thank
you
,
"
that
is
my
"
But
have
"
intention
.
you
found
another
captain
for
the
convict
ship
?
"
asked
Lord
Somers
.
"
Yes
-
-
I
have
been
looking
into
the
matter
with
the
view
of
saving
you
further
trouble
.
I
have
settled
on
a
man
a
first
-
rate
master
mariner
and
commander
,
and
who
is
now
in
London
,
disengaged
.

who
is
classed
as

I
shall
make
a
note
of
it
,

said
Lord
Somers
,
taking
out
his
pocket
-
book
.
"
What
is
his
name
?
"
"
Draper
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
;
"
Captain
Samuel
Draper
.
"
"
That
will
do
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
"
I
shall
have
new
articles
made
out
.
Will
y
you
see
to
it
that
he
is
engaged
at
ance
,
and
sent
to
the
ship
at
Portland
?

"
Certainly
.
I
shall
attend
to
it
to
-
day

Mr.
Hamerton
and
Sheridan
,
who
had
been
talking
together
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
now
approached
,
and
the
conversation
became
general
.
Soon
after
,
Lord
Somers
said
"
Good

morning

and
proceeded
to

Department
