He
struck
his
spurs
,
into
his
horse
,
and
the
animal
sprang
to
the
front
.
But
next
instant
he
was
flung
back
on
his
haunches
by
Ngarra
-
jil
,
dismounted
,
who
had
seized
the
bridle
.
The
bushman's
eyes
blazed
,
and
his
face
was
set
in
determination
.
"
No
!
no
!
"
he
cried
in
his
own
language
;
"
you
shall
no
you
shall
not
!
It
is
death
,
MOONDYNE
!
It
is
death

"
Wyville
bent
forward
,
broke
the
man's
grasp
,
speaking
rapidly
to
him
.
His
words
moved
the
faithful
heart
deeply
,
and
he
stood
aside
,
with
raised
hands
of
affliction
,
and
let
him
ride
forward
.
Hamerton
did
not
follow
;
but
he
would
not
try
to
escape
.
He
sat
in
his
saddle
,
with
streaming
eyes
following
the
splendid
heroism
of
the
man
he
loved
dearest
of
all
the
world
.
It
was
a
ride
that
could
only
be
faced
by
audacious
bravery
.
The
hot
breath
of
the
leaping
fire
was
moving
whole
bush
through
which
Wyville
rade

on
the
trees

an
man
and
horse
.
But
the
rider
only
saw
before
him
the
human
beings
he
meant
to
save
.
Nearer
and
nearer
he
drew
;
and
he
shouted
,
as
best
he
could
,
to
cheer
them
;
but
they
did
not
hear
him
.
the
He
saw
with
straining
eyes
the
man
throw
up
his
hands
and
sink
to
the
earth
;
and
he
saw
the
woman
,
faithful
to
the
last
,
bending
over
him
,
holding
the
wine
flask
to
his
parched
lips
.
He
saw
her
,
too
,
reach
out
her
arms
,
as
if
to
shield
the
fallen
one
from
the
cruel
flame
that
had
seized
them
.
Then
she
breathed
the
air
of
fire
,
and
sank
down
.
Next
moment
,
Wyville
leaped
from
his
horse
beside
them
.
It
was
too
late
.
The
woman
had
fallen
in
front
of
the
flame
,
as
if
to
keep
it
from
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
deserved
so
little
of
her
devotion
;
and
still
the
hand
of
the
faithful
dead
held
to
his
lips
the
draught
that
might
have
saved
her
own
life
.
One
moment
,
with
quivering
face
,
the
strong
man
bent
above
her
,
while
his
lips
moved
.
Then
he
raised
his
head
,
and
faced
his
own
danger
.
Already
the
fire
had
cut
him
off
;
but
it
was
only
the
advanced
line
of
the
conflagration
that
bad
reached
the
water
.
It
was
possible
to
dash
back
,
by
the
edge
of
the
swamp
.
The
awful
peril
of
the
moment
flashed
on
him
as
he
rode
.
The
horse
bounded
wildly
ahead
;
and
the
skilled
hand
guided
him
for
the
best
.
But
,
as
he
flew
,
other
scenes
rose
before
the
rider
even
brighter
than
that
before
him
.
The
present
was
filled
with
horror
;
but
the
past
overtook
him
and
swept
over
his
heart
like
a
great
wave
of
peace
.
A
tree
crashed
to
the
earth
across
his
path
.
He
was
forced
to
drive
his
horse
into
the
fire
to
get
round
the
abstacle
.
The
animal
reared
and
screamed
,
but
dashed
through
the
fire
,
with
.
scorched
and
blinded
poor
eyes
.
by
the
flame
,
now
solely
dependent
on
the
hand
of
its
guide
.
The
rider
felt
the
suffering
animal's
pain
,
and
recorded
it
in
his
heart
with
sympathy
.
It
was
that
heart's
last
record
,
and
it
was
worthy
of
the
broad
manhood
that
had
graved
it
there
.
He
had
given
his
life
for
men-
-
he
could
pity
a
dumb
animal
.
By
the
side
of
the
swamp
he
was
stricken
from
the
saddle
by
the
branch
of
a
falling
tree
.
His
body
fell
in
the
water
,
his
head
resting
on
the
tangled
rushes
of
the
swamp
.
Once
,
before
he
died
,
his
opened
eyes
were
raised
,
and
he
looked
above
him
into
the
sea
and
forest
of
fire
.
But
he
would
not
accept
that
;
but
upwards
,
with
the
splendid
faith
of
his
old
manhood
,
went
the
glazing
eyes
till
they
rested
firmly
on
the
eternal
calmness
of
the
sky
.
As
he
looked
,
there
came
to
him
,
like
a
vision
he
had
once
before
dimly
seen
,
a
great
Thought
from
the
deep
sky
,
and
held
his
soul
in
rapt
communion
.
But
the
former
dimness
was
.
;
he
saw
it
clearly
now
for
.
one
instant
,
while
all
things
were
closing
peacefully
in
upon
him
.
gone
Then
the
man's
head
sank
peacefully
to
its
couch
,
the
limbs
stretched
out
for
their
lone
,
rest
,
the
strong
heart
stopped
its
labours
.
He
was
dead
.
They
found
his
body
next
day
,
unscathed
by
the
fire
,
preserved
by
the
water
in
which
he
had
fallen

One

children

had
no

to

race

The
old
chief
read
profound
grief
in
his
face
,
and
drew
closer
to
him
.
"
This
man
"
belonged
to

he
said
,

his
dark
finger

on

than

shall
