was
an
experiment
far
more

to
poor

than
to
the

When

the
blow
appeared
terrible
;

in
truth
it
only
struck
Haggett

As

Mr.
Haggett's
face
was
lined
with
one
day
good
humour
and
gratification
..
When
the
ship
was
becalmed
in
the
tropics
,
the
suffering
of
the
imprisoned
wretches
in
the
steaming
and
crowded
hold
was
piteous
to
see
.
.
They
were
so
packed
that
free
movement
was
impossible
.
The
best
thing
to
do
was
to
sit
each
on
his
or
her
berth
,
and
suffer
in
patience
.
The
air
was
stifling
and
oppressive
.
There
was
no
draught
through
the
barred
hatches
.
The
deck
above
them
was
blazing
hot
.
The
pitch
dropped
from
the
seams
,
and
burned
their
flesh
as
it
fell
.
There
was
only
one
word
spoken
or
thought-
-one
yearning
idea
present
in
every
mind
-
