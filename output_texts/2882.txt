and

It
was
very
low
,
only
one
story
high
for
the
most
part
,
though
there
were
a
number
of
sleeping
.
rooms
raised
to
a
second
story
.
From
the
verandah
,
looking
seaward
,
every
part
of
the
wooded
valley
was
visible
,
and
the
winding
silver
of
the
rivers
glanced
deliciously
through
the
trees
.
Beyond
,
lay
the
level
blue
water
of
the
Indian
Ocean
,
stretching
away
to
the
cream
-
coloured
horizon
.
The
house
within
doors
was
a
wonder
of
richness
,
taste
,
and
comfort
.
Everything
was
of
wood
,
highly
finished
with
polish
and
carving
,
and
the
colours
were
combined
of
various
woods
.
Soft
rugs
from
India
and
Persia
lay
on
halls
and
rooms
.
Books
,
pictures
,
statuary

,
everything
that
vast
wealth
and
cultivated
taste
could
command
or
desire
,
was
to
be
found
in
this
splendid
residence
.
Almost
in
silence
,
the
strangers
passed
through
the
countless
rooms
,
each
differing
from
the
others
,
and
seen
it
himself
;
each
complete
.
Mr.
Wyville
led
the
larger
party
of
guests
through
the
place
.
He
had
not
before
s
but
he
was
wholly
familiar
with
the
plans
,
which
,
indeed
,
were
largely
his
own
.
"
But
it
will
have
an
owner
now
,
"
he
said
,
"
who
will
better
enjoy
its
restfulness
,
and
take
closer
interest
in
its
people
.
"
"
But
you
your
excellent
law
.
"
i
should
rest
,
too
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
said
Mrs.
Little
;
"
the
colony
is
now
settled
with
y
"
There
is
much
to
be
done
yet
,
"
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
,
with
the
old
grave
smile
.
"
I
have
not
even
time
to
wait
one
"
e
day
.
"
There
was
a
general
look
of
astonishment
.
"
Why
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
surely
you
will
not
leave
this
lovely
place
-
-
"
I
must
leave
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
Very
sorry
"
but
it
is
imperative
.
"
Then
,
not
waiting
for
further
comment
,
he
took
them
out
to
the
stables
and
village
-
like
out
-
houses
.
There
was
no
regular
garden
;
the
valley
itself
was
garden
and
farm
and
forest
in
one
.
Alice
Walmsley
had
lingered
behind
the
others
,
in
a
quiet
and
dim
little
room
,
looking
away
out
to
sea
Contentment
filled
her
soul
like
low
music
.
The
wished
to
be
alone
.
She
had
sat
only
a
few
minutes
when
she
heard
a
step
beside
her
.
She
did
not
look
.
;
she
knew
whose
hand
was
round
her
cheek
,
and
standing
over
up
her
.
They
did
not
say
a
word
;
but
remained
still
for
a
long
,
long
time
,
Then
he
bent
over
her
,
turning
her
face
to
his
.
She
raised
her
arms
,
and
he
took
her
to
his
breast
and
lips
in
the
fullness
of
happiness
and
love
.
When
they
left
the
dim
little
room
,
which
was
ever
after
to
be
the
dearest
to
them
in
their
rich
home
,
they
saw
the
sombre
robes
of
Sister
Cecilia
as
she
sat
alone
on
the
verandah
.
"
Where
shall
the
school
be
,
Sister
?
"
asked
Sheridan
;
"
have
you
selected
your
site
?
"
"
She
shall
build
it
on
the
choicest
spot
that
can
be
found
,
"
said
Alice
,
seating
herself
beside
Sister
Cecilia
.
"
Dictation
already
!
"
laughed
Sheridan
,
at
which
Alice
blushed
,
and
sent
him
away
.
Towards
evening
y
there
stood
on
the
verandah
,
having
quietly
withdrawn
from
the
guests
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
Sheridan
,
and
Hamerton
.
Mr.
Wyville
meant
quietly
to
leave
,
without
disturbing
the
party
"
I
I
am
sorry
beyond
expression
,
"
said
Sheridan
,
holding
his
hand
;
"
your
presence
was
our
chief
pleasure
.
Can
you
not
even
stay
with
us
to
-
night
?
"
"
It
is
impossible
!
"
answered
Mr.
Wyville
,
with
a
look
of
affectionate
response
;
"
the
work
yet
before
!
bear
delay
.
Good
-
bye
.
God
bless
,
you--
and
yours
!
"
He
walked
rapidly
away
,
his
horse
having
been
led
by
Ben
Lodge
before
him
to
the
entrance
.
"
Good
-
bye
,
Sheridan
,
"
said
Hamerton
,
suddenly
seizing
his
friend's
hand
,
"
I'm
g
"
What
?
You--
"
going
,
too
.
me
will
not
"
Stop
!
Don't
try
to
prevent
me
.
I
can't
let
him
.
go
alone
.
Go
in
to
your
people
,
and
say
nothing
till
to
-
morrow
.
Goodbye
,
my
dear
fellow
.
"
That
night
the
steamer
returned
to
Fremantle
,
having
y
on
board
Mr.
Wyville
and
Hamerton
.
THE
CONVICT'S
PASS
.
ON
Mr.
Wyville's
return
from
the
Vasse
,
he
set
himself
with
tireless
will
to
the
complete
organization
of
the
Penal
Law
.
Not
content
with
writing
copious
rules
for
the
guidance
of
warders
,
he
proposed
to
visit
all
the
districts
in
the
colony
,
and
personally
instruct
the
chief
officers
of
depots
,
from
whom
the
system
would
pass
directly
to
their
subordinates
.
some
of
his
old
farmers
from
England
to
settle
on
it
.
For
many
days
Mr.
Hamerton
saw
little
of
him
,
and
the
time
was
heavy
on
his
hands
.
He
intended
to
purchase
land
in
the
colony
,
and
brings
One
day
,
he
went
to
the
prison
at
Fremantle
,
and
waited
for
Mr.
Wyville
in
his
office
.
As
he
sat
there
,
by
a
window
that
looked
over
a
wide
stretch
of
sandy
scrub
,
he
noticed
that
though
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
heat
intense
,
a
heavy
cloud
like
dense
vapour
hung
over
all
the
lowland
.
He
remembered
that
for
a
few
days
past
he
had
observed
the
smoky
sultriness
of
the
atmosphere
,
but
had
concluded
that
it
was
the
natural
appression
of
the
season
.
