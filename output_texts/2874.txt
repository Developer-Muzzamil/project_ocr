proceed
,
and
,
laying
her
hand
on
a
low
branch
beside
the
path
,
turned
to
him
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
she
said
,
"
has
Mr.
Sheridan
told
you
the
cause
of
his
unhappiness
?
"
"
He
has
,
"
he
replied
,
astonished
at
the
abrupt
question
;
"
it
is
most
unfortunate
and
utterly
hopeless
.
Time
alone
can
heal
the
deep
wound
.
He
has
told
me
that
you
knew
him
years
ago
:
you
probably
know
the
sad
story
.
"
"
I
do
not
know
it
,
"
she
said
,
supporting
herself
by
the
branch
.
"
He
loved
a
woman
with
a
man's
love
while
yet
a
boy
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
he
saw
her
lured
from
him
by
a
villain
,
"
who
blighted
her
life
into
hopeless
ruin
.
"
"
Does
he
love
her
still
?
"
asked
Alice
,
her
face
turned
to
the
darkened
bush
.
"
He
pities
her
,
for
she
is
wretched
and-
-guilty
.
"
At
the
word
,
Alice
let
.
the
branch
,
and
stood
straight
in
the
road
.
go
"
Guilty
?
"
she
said
;
in
a
strange
voice
.
"
Miss
Walmsley
,
I
am
deeply
grieved
at
having
introduced
this
subject
.
But
I
thought
you
knew
-
-Mr
.
Sheridan
,
I
thought
,
intimated
as
much
.
The
woman
he
loved
is
the
unhappy
.
one
for
whom
you
suffered
.
Her
husband
is
still
alive
,
and
in
this
country
.
I
brought
him
here
,
to
give
him
,
when
she
is
released
,
a
chance
of
atonement
.
"
A
light
burst
on
Alice's
mind
as
Mr.
Wyville
spoke
,
and
she
with
difficulty
kept
from
sinking
.
She
reached
for
the
low
branch
again
,
but
she
did
not
find
it
in
the
dark
.
To
preserve
her
control
she
walked
on
towards
the
house
,
though
her
steps
were
hurried
and
irregular
.
Mr.
Wyville
,
thinking
that
her
emotion
was
caused
by
painful
recollections
,
accompanied
her
without
a
word
.
He
was
profoundly
sorry
!
&
that
he
had
given
her
pain
.
Alice
knew
,
as
well
as
if
he
had
spoken
his
thought
,
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
.
As
one
travelling
in
the
dark
will
see
a
whole
valley
in
one
flash
of
lightning
,
Alice
had
seen
the
error
under
which
Mr.
Wyville
laboured
,
and
all
its
causes
,
in
that
one
moment
of
illumination
.
Then
,
too
,
she
read
his
heart
,
filled
with
deep
feeling
,
and
unconscious
of
the
gulf
before
it
;
and
the
knowledge
flooded
her
with
sorrow
At
the
door
of
the
house
,
Mrs.
Little
met
them
with
an
air
of
bustle
.
of
them
an
old
friend
,
and
you
"
Why
,
Alice
!
"
she
exclaimed
,
"
two
gentlemen
coming
to
dinner
,
and
one
laitering
by
the
river
like
a
school
-
girl
.
Mr.
Wyville
,
I
believe
you
kept
Alice
till
she
has
barely
time
to
put
a
ribbon
in
her
hair
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
,
with
some
easy
turn
of
the
subject
,
covered
Alice's
disquiet
,
and
then
took
his
leave
,
going
to
Perth
,
to
return
later
with
Sheridan
and
Hamerton
.
"
Dear
Mrs.
Little
,
"
said
Alice
,
when
his
horse's
hoofs
sounded
on
the
road
,
"
you
must
not
ask
me
to
dine
with
you
to
-
night
.
Let
me
go
to
the
children
.
"
There
was
something
in
her
voice
and
face
that
touched
the
kind
matron
,
and
she
at
once
assented
,
only
saying
she
was
sorry
for
Alice's
sake
.
"
But
will
see
Mr.
Sheridan
?
"
she
said
.
"
Mr.
Little
you
says
"
I
will
see
him
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Alice
,
"
indeed
,
I
am
not
able
to
see
.
!!
he
was
very
particular
in
asking
for
you
.
"
to
-
night
.
"
anyone
An
hour
later
,
when
the
guests
arrived
,
Alice
sat
in
her
unlighted
.
room
,
and
heard
their
voices
,
and
one
voice
,
that
she
remembered
as
from
yesterday
,
mentioned
her
name
,
and
then
remained
silent
.
THE
MEETING
WITH
the
first
warm
flush
of
morning
Alice
was
away
.
y
on
her
favourite
lonely
walk
by
the
river
.
The
day
opened
,
like
almost
all
days
in
West
Australia
,
with
a
glorious
richness
of
light
,
colour
,
and
life
.
The
grand
shadowy
stretches
in
the
bush
were
neither
silent
nor
humid
,
as
in
tropical
countries
.
Every
inch
of
ground
sent
up
its
jet
of
colour
,
exquisite
though
scentless
;
and
all
the
earth
hummed
with
insect
life
,
while
the
trees
flashed
with
the
splendid
colours
of
countless
bright
-
necked
birds
.
Alice
breathed
in
the
wondrous
beauty
of
her
surroundings
.
Her
heart
,
so
long
unresponsive
,
had
burst
into
full
harmony
with
the
generous
nature
of
the
Australian
bush
.
Down
by
the
river
,
where
the
spreading
mahogany
trees
reached
far
over
the
water
,
she
loved
to
walk
in
the
early
morning
and
at
the
close
of
the
day
.
Thither
she
went
this
morning
;
and
an
hour
later
someone
followed
steps
,
directed
where
to
find
her
by
Mrs.
Little
.
her
That
morning
to
see
her
.
as
she
left
the
house
,
Mrs.
Little
had
told
her
that
Mr.
Sheridan
was
to
call
early
,
and
had
asked
"
I
shall
be
home
very
soon
,
"
Alice
said
,
as
she
went
out
.
But
she
did
not
return
soon
;
and
when
Mr.
Sheridan
called
,
much
earlier
than
he
was
expected
,
Mrs.
Little
told
him
where
Miss
Walmsley
usually
spent
her
mornings
,
and
he
,
leaving
his
horse
in
the
stable
,
walked
down
