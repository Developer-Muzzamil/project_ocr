whole
face
radiant
with
faith
and
sorrow
and
prayer
.
"
O
,
thank
God
!
"
she
whispered
,
her
weeping
eyes
resting
y
on
the
beautiful
deep
sky
.
Thank
God
for
this
little
flower
.
O
,
mother
,
hear
me
in
heaven
,
and
pray
for
me
,
that
God
may
forgive
me
for
doubting
and
denying
His
love
!
"
-she
sank
upon
her
knees
by
the
bedside
,
and
poured
her
full
heart
in
passionate
prayer
.
With
streaming
eyes-
·
And
,
as
she
prayed
,
kneeling
an
the
stones
of
her
cell
,
with
bowed
head
,
the
beautiful
,
high
in
the
vault
of
night
,
and
its
radiance
flooded
the
cell
,
as
moon
had
risen
if
God's
blessing
were
made
manifest
in
the
lovely
light
,
that
was
only
broken
by
the
dark
reflection
of
the
window
bars
,
falling
upon
the
mourner
in
the
form
of
a
a
cross
.
It
was
long
past
midnight
when
she
lay
down
to
rest
.
But
next
day
Alice
began
her
monotonous
toil
as
on
all
previous
,
days
.
She
was
restless
,
unhappy
;
her
face
was
stained
with
weeping
in
the
lone
,
vigil
of
the
night
.
But
her
heart
had
changed
with
the
brief
rest
she
had
taken
.
She
began
her
day
.
without
Her
mind
had
moved
too
long
in
one
deep
groove
to
allow
its
prayer
.
direction
to
be
changed
without
laborious
effort
.
The
little
flower
that
had
touched
her
heart
so
deeply
the
day
before
,
lay
upon
the
low
shelf
of
her
cell
.
Alice
took
it
up
with
a
movement
of
the
lips
that
would
have
been
a
sad
smile
but
for
the
emptiness
of
her
poor
heart
.
"
It
grew
in
its
garden
,
and
loved
its
sweet
life
,
"
she
thought
;
"
and
when
the
sun
was
brightest
,
the
selfish
Hand
approached
and
tore
it
from
its
stem
,
to
throw
it
next
day
into
the
street
,
perhaps
.
"
Then
flashed
,
for
the
first
time
,
into
her
mind
the
question
-
-
Who
had
placed
the
flower
in
her
cell
?
Had
she
been
unjust
--
and
had
the
Hand
that
pulled
this
flower
been
moved
by
kindness
,
and
kindness
to
her
?
The
thought
troubled
her
,
and
she
became
timid
and
impressionable
again
.
Who
had
brought
her
this
flower
?
Whoever
had
done
so
was
a
friend
,
and
pitied
her
.
Else
why
--
but
perhaps
every
prisoner
in
the
ward
had
also
received
a
flower
.
Her
heart
closed
,
and
her
lips
became
firm
at
the
thought
.
A
few
minutes
later
,
she
pulled
the
signal
wire
of
her
cell
,
which
moved
a
red
board
outside
the
door
,
so
that
it
stood
at
right
angles
from
the
wall
.
This
brought
the
warder
,
to
know
what
was
wanted
.
The
door
was
opened
,
and
the
warder
,
a
woman
with
a
severe
face
but
a
kind
eye
,
stood
in
the
entrance
.
Alice
had
the
flower
in
her
hand
"
Have
all
the
prisoners
received
flowers
like
this
?
"
she
inquired
,
with
a
steady
voice
.
"
No
,
"
said
the
warder
.
In
five
years
,
"
Why
this
was
the
first
question
Number
Four
had
ever
asked
.
¡
was
this
given
to
me
?
"
she
asked
,
her
voice
losing
its
firmness
,
and
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
.
"
I
don't
know
,
"
said
the
warder
.
This
was
true
:
the
hand
that
had
dropped
the
flower
into
the
watch
-
grate
had
done
so
unseen
.
The
warder
only
knew
that
orders
had
been
received
from
the
governor
that
Number
Four
was
not
to
be
disturbed
,
nor
the
flower
taken
away
.
The
door
closed
again
,
and
Alice
raised
the
flower
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
.
Someone
had
pitied
her
--
had
thought
of
her
.
She
was
not
alone
in
the
world
.
This
reflection
she
could
not
drive
away
.
She
sat
down
to
her
work
;
but
she
could
not
see
the
cloth
--
her-
were
blurred
with
tears
,
her
hands
trembled
.
At
last
she
rose
and
pressed
her
convulsively
open
eyes
hands
to
her
streaming
eyes
,
and
then
sank
on
her
knees
beside
her
bed
,
and
sobbed
How
long
she
remained
so
she
did
not
know
,
but
she
felt
a
band
laid
softly
oil
her
head
,
and
heard
her
name
called
in
a
low
voice--
"
Alice
!
"
A
woman
had
entered
the
cell
,
and
was
kneeling
beside
her
.
Alice
raised
her
head
,
and
let
her
eyes
rest
on
a
face
as
beautiful
as
an
angel's
,
a
face
as
white
as
if
it
were
a
prisoner's
,
but
calm
and
sweet
and
sympathetic
in
every
feature
;
and
round
the
lovely
face
Alice
san
a
strange
,
white
band
,
that
made
it
look
like
a
face
in
a
picture
.
It
was
a
Sister
of
Mercy
she
had
seen
before
when
she
worked
in
the
hospital
;
she
remembered
she
had
seen
came
her
once
sit
up
all
night
bathing
the
brow
of
a
sick
girl
,
dying
of
fever
.
This
thought
.
as
she
looked
at
Sister
Cecilia's
face
,
and
saw
the
unselfishness
and
devotion
of
her
life
in
her
"
Alice
,
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
,
"
why
do
you
grieve
so
deeply
?
Tell
me
"
why
you
are
so
clearly
to
her
mind
look
pure
unhappy
--
tell
me
,
dear
,
and
I
will
try
to
make
you
happier
,
or
I
will
grieve
with
you
.
"
Alice
felt
her
whole
self
-
command
deserting
her
,
and
her
heart
melting
at
the
kindness
of
the
voice
and
Words
.
"
Turn
to
me
,
and
trust
me
-
-
,
dear
,
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
.
"
Tell
me
why
you
weep
so
bitterly
.
I
know
you
are
innocent
of
crime
,
Alice
;
I
never
believed
you
guilty
.
And
now
I
have
come
to
bring
you
comfort
.
"
