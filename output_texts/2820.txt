She

She

When
she
gave

into

joined
its
supplication
to
hers
,
she
believed
,
nay
,
she
knew
,
that

happiness
would
be

to
her
.
But
before
that
day
came
,
she
was
left
alone

When

long
voyage
,
she
was
pleased
,
and
thought
gladly
of
the
change
for
her
,
who
had
never
seen
the
great
world
.
When
he
coldly
said
that
she
was
to
remain
,
she
became
alarmed
--
she
could
not
be
left
alone
--she
implored
,
she
prayed
to
go
with
him
.
Then
came
the
sneer
,
the
brutal
refusal
,
the
master's
command
,
the
indelible
insult
of
expressed
weariness
and
dislike
.
She
held
her
peace
.
When
the
day
came
,
he
would
have

for
years

absence
,
without

;

,
could
not
bear
this
blighting
memory
:
•
She
clung
to
him
,
sobbing
her
full
heart
on
his
breast
;
she
kissed
him
and
prayed
for
him
,
with
her
hands
on

shoulders
,

her

would

.
With
such
words
she
let
him
go
.
breast
Firmly
and
faithfully
the
loving
heart
kept
this
last
promise
.
Months
passed
,
and
her
lonely
home
grew
very
dear
to
her
.
Her
young
heart
refused
to
remember
the
pain
of
the
past
,
and
would
recall
,
day
after
day
,
untiringly
,
the
few
poor
pleasures
of
her
wedded
life
.
She
would
not
allow
herself
to
think
how
much
even
of
these
pleasures
was
due
to
others
than
her
husband
-
-
to
her
mother
and
her
old
friends
.
But
all
her
sorrow
died
,
and
her
doubt
and
fear
fled
away
on
the
day
when
she
took
to
her
the
sweet
baby
that
was
hers
and
his
.
God's
eye
seemed
too
full
of
love
that
day
.
The
harvest
of
her
y
life
was
the
bursting
of
a
flower
of
exquisite
joy
.
Her
baby
was
a
prayer
-
-God
had
come
near
to
her
,
and
had
sent
her
an
angelic
present
.
Her
life
for
many
days
was
a
ceaseless
crooning
melody
of
soft
happiness
,
mingled
with
prayers
for
her
husband
absent
on
the
sea

Then
came
the
lightning
,
and
blasted
her
fabric
of
joy
,
and
shrivelled
her

into
hopelessness
before
her
face
.
One
moment
it
rose
.
fair
and
sightly
and
splendid
;
the
next
,
it
was
scattered
at
her
scorched
feet
,
pile
of
blackened
and
pitiful
ruin
.
O
,
day
of
sorrow
,
would
it
had
been
of
death
!
It
was
a
bright
and
happy
morning
,
and
she
sat
in
her
pleasant
little
room
,
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
.
She
had
been
dreaming
awake
.
She
was
full
of
peace
and
thankfulness
for
her
exceeding
joy
.
Suddenly
Woman's
;
a
shadow
fell
upon
her
--someone
had
entered
the
room
.
She
looked
up
,
and
met
a
terrible
face
-
-
-a
s
face
,
glaring
at
her
and
her
child
.
She
could
not
scream
--she
was
paralyzed
with
terror
.
The
face
was
crowded
with
passion
--
every
dreadful
line
seemed
to
possess
a
voice
of
wrath
and
hatred
.
Alice
had
no
power
to
defend
herself
;
but
she
folded
her
baby
closer
to
her
breast
,
and
looked
straight
at
the
dreadful
face
.
"
You
think
you
are
his
wife
!
"
cried
the
woman
,
with
a
laugh
of
hideous
derision
.
"
You
think
he
loves
you
!
"
lie
!
You
lie
!
He
is
my
!
y
husband
!
He
never
was
yours
!
He
is
mine
,
mine
!
And
he
lied
to
you
!
"
More
was
said
by
the
woman
--
much
more
;
but
it
all
resolved
itself
into
this
in
Alice's
confused
memory
.
Papers
the
stranger
produced
,
and
held
before
Alice's
eyes
.
She
read
the
written
words--
--they
were
You
transferred
to
her
brain
in
letters
of
fire
.
Nearer
and
nearer
came
the
dreadful
woman
,
and
more
threatening
the
insults
she
hissed
into
Alice's
face
.
She
laid
her
hand
on
the
baby's
shoulder
,
and
crushed
it
,
cursing
it
.
Still
Alice
could
not
scream
.
Her
heart
gave
irregular
throbs
-
-
her
brain
was
beginning
to
reel
.
Nearer
,
still
the
hateful
face
--
the
words
struck
her
in
the
like
missiles
--
they
sprang
!
her
body
grew
weak
,
the
baby
fell
from
her
breast
and
lay
upon
her
knees
-
-
O
God
!
the
silent
agony
--
the

eyes
like
knives
at
her
heart--
terrible
stranger
had
seized
the
child
--
the
mother's
senses
.
-failed
--
the
sunlight
grew
dark
--
the
sufferer
fell
unconscious
at
her
enemy's
feet
.
When
she
raised
her
head
,
after
hours
of
a
merciful
blank
,
she
was
alone
-
-
her
baby
lay
dead
before
her
--
and
the
love
and
trust
of
her
life
lay
stark
and
strangled
by
its
side
.
What
more
?
Nay
,
there
was
no
more
to
be
borne
.
The
worst
had
come
.
The
flaming
rocket
had
spent
its
last
spark
in
the
dark
sky--
--the
useless
stick
was
falling
to
the
earth
,
to
be
forgotten
forever
.
