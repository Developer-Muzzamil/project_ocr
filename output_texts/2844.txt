Mr.
Wyville
left
the
office
,
and
the
clerk
collected
his
papers
,
from
which
the
visitor
had
taken
notes
.
Mr.
Wyville
hailed
a
cab
,
and
said
to
the
driver
,
"
Horton
street
.
"
It
was
a
long
way
off
,
and
during
the
slow
progress
through
the
crowded
streets
,
Mr.
Wyville
examined
his
notes
and
arranged
them
carefully
certain
order
.
At
last
the
cab
stopped
.
"
What
number
?
"
asked
the
driver
.
in
a
"
I
shall
get
out
here
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
But
you
may
wait
for
me-
--say
half
an
hour
.
"
He
walked
down
the
quiet
little
street
,
with
its
uniform
brick
houses
,
green
blinds
,
and
white
curtains
.
It
was
a
street
of
comfortable
residences
of
small
business
men
and
well
-
to
-
do
mechanics
.
Number
87
was
in
no
different
from
the
neighbouring
houses
.
way
Mr.
Wyville
rang
the
bell
,
and
an
old
lady
,
with
glasses
pushed
up
to
her
forehead
,
and
a
piece
of
sewing
in
her
hand
,
opened
the
door
,
and
looked
inquiringly
at
the
caller
.
"
Does
Captain
Draper
live
here
?
"
he
asked
.
"
"
Yes
,
sir
,
but
he
is
out
at
present
,
"
said
the
intelligent
old
lady
.
"
I
am
sorry
;
I
will
call
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
turning
to
go
.
"
"
"
He
will
be
in
soon
,
"
said
the
old
lady
;
"
he
comes
in
to
dinner
always
.
"
"
Then
I
shall
wait
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
;
and
he
entered
the
house
,
and
sat
down
in
a
comfortable
little
parlour
,
while
the
old
woman
,
drawing
down
her
glasses
,
went
on
with
her
sewing
"
Captain
Draper
is
my
grand
-
nephew
,
"
said
she
,
after
a
silent
interval
:
you
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Then
y
will
be
pleased
to
know
that
I
Iam
come
to
offer
him
a
good
command
.
"
"
Oh
,
I
am
delighted
!
"
said
the
old
lady
;
"
he
is
so
good
,.
;
so
conscientious
.
I
always
said
as
Samuel
would
come
to
something
'
igh
.
He
has
been
waiting
for
a
ship
for
nearly
a
year
..
I
know
he
doesn't
please
his
owners
,
because
he
is
too
conscientious
.
"
"
You
will
also
be
pleased
to
hear
,
madam
,
that
his
owners
this
time
will
be
quite
conscientious
,
too
.
"
"
I
am
sa
delighted
!
"
said
Captain
Draper's
grand
-
aunt
.
At
this
moment
the
outer
door
opened
,
and
immediately
after
Captain
Draper
entered
the
room
.
It
was
rather
a
chilly
day
,
and
he
had
buttoned
his
coat
close
up
to
his
throat
.
He
was
not
a
robust
figure
-
-rather
slim
,
and
bent
forward
.
The
past
ten
years
boisterous
laugh
and
hearty
,
younger
.
his
prominent
blue
.
eyes
bad
laid
a
hand
on
him
.
The
charm
of
his
strong
manhood
,
the
&
manner
of
waving
his
hand
,
was
much
lessened
;
but
the
cold
watchfulness
of
was
proportionately
increased
.
He
had
a
long
and
narrow
face
,
thin
jaws
,
covered
with
faded
whiskers
,
worn
rather
long
.
His
upper
lip
and
chin
were
shaven
,
showing
his
wide
mouth
.
His
lips
were
dry
,
as
of
old
,
but
now
they
were
bluer
,
and
more
offensively
cracked
.
On
the
whole
,
he
was
a
decent
-
looking
.
man
in
outward
appearance
;
as
he
walked
rapidly
through
the
streets
,
with
shoulders
bent
forward
,
one
would
say
he
was
a
consumptive
hurrying
home
.
But
there
was
a
compression
of
the
mouth
,
accompanied
with
a
quick
watchfulness
of
eye
,
and
an
ugly's
sneer
in
the
muscles
of
the
nose
,
that
would
make
his
face
detestable
to
perceiving
character
.
anyone
who
had
the
power
of
rapidly
Mr.
Wyville
read
the
face
as
easily
as
if
it
were
a
printed
page
.
"
Captain
Draper
,
I
presume
?
"
"
That
is
my
name
,
"
said
the
other
,
with
a
wide
and
unmeaning
smile
of
the
cracked
lips
,
in
which
the
rest
of
the
face
took
no
part
.
"
I
have
come
from
the
Treasury
,
to
offer
you
command
of
a
vessel
in
the
service
of
the
Government
.
'
"
Ah
--
that's
good
.
In
what
branch
of
the
service
,
"
Transport
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Troops
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Draper
,
still
smiling
.
"
Na
;
convicts
.
"
"
I
ask
?
"
may
Captain
Draper
placed
a
chair
so
as
to
see
Mr.
Wyville's
face
in
the
light
.
As
he
took
his
seat
he
had
ceased
to
smile
.
"
Ah
!
--
convicts
.
Where
are
"
West
Australia
.
"
they
going
?
"
Captain
Draper
remained
silent
so
long
that
Mr.
Wyville
spoke
again
.
"
You
are
willing
to
take
such
a
vessel
,
are
you
not
?
"
--Are
they
male
convicts
?
"
he
asked
,
"
Well
,
I
want
a
ship
--
but
these
convict
ships
I
don't
like
;
I
don't
want
to
-
-
interrupting
himself
.
"
Yes
,
mainly
,
there
will
be
three
hundred
men
,
and
only
fifty
female
convicts
on
board
.
"
"
Fifty
.
"
Draper
.
stood
up
and
walked
across
the
room
to
the
mantelpiece
.
He
leant
his
elbow
on
it
for
a
time
,
