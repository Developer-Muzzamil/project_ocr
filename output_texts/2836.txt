Mr.
Wyville
led
his
companion
to
speak
of
the
sandalwood
trade
,
and
seemed
to
be
much
interested
in
its
details
.
At
one
point
he
interrupted
Sheridan
,
who
was
describing
the
precipitous
outer
ridge
of
the
Iron
-
stone
Hills
.
"
Your
teams
have
to
follow
the
winding
foot
of
this
precipice
for
many
miles
,
have
they
not
?
"
he
asked
.
"
For
thirty
-
two
miles
,
"
answered
Sheridan
.
"
Which
,
of
course
,
adds
much
to
the
expense
of
shipping
the
sandalwood
?
"
so
that

teams

"
Suppose
it
were
possible
to
throw

from

of

Head

on

--
what
would
that
save

Sheridan

"
"
The
Americans
have
made
slides
for
wood
nearly
as
long
,

said
Mr.
Wyville
.
Five
ships
could
not
carry
enough

from

said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
The
very
hills
can
be
smelted
into

.
I
have
had
this
in
mind
for
Mr.
Sheridan
,
and
I
I
mean
to
attempt
the
work
when

return

"
صدر
familiar
with
the
very
scenes
Sheridan
was
surprised
beyond
words
to
find
Mr.
Wyvilles
of
his
own
labour
.
He
hardly
knew
what
to
say
about
Wyville's
personal
interest
in
a
district
which
the
Sandalwood
Company
had
marked
off
and
claimed
as
their
property
by
right
of
possession
,
though
they
had
neglected
Sheridan's
advice
to
buy
or
lease
the
land
from
the
Government
.
pen
The
conversation
ceased
as
they
entered
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
proceeded
to
the
committee
room
,
where
sat
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
at
a
table
,
turning
over
a
pile
of
documents
,
and
beside
him
,
in
hand
,
Mr.
Haggett
,
who
took
in
a
reef
of
lip
as
Mr.
Wyville
and
Sheridan
entered
.
Since
Haggett's
return
from
Australia
,
three
years
before
,
he
had
adopted
a
peculiar
manner
towards
Mr.
Wyville
.
He
treated
him
with
respect
,
perhaps
because
he
feared
him
;
but
when
he
could
observe
him
without
be
never
tired
of
looking
at
him
,
as
if
he
were
intently
solving
a
problem
,
and
hoped
to
himself
being
seen
,
read
its
deepest
meaning
in
some
possible
expression
of
Mr.
Wyville's
face
.
On
the
large
table
lay
a
map
of
the
penal
colony
of
West
Australia
.
The
Committee
consisted
of
five
average
M.P.'s
,
three
country
gentlemen
,
who
had
not
the
remotest
nor
knowledge
of
penal
systems
,
of
any
other
than
systems
of
drainage
;
and
two
lawyers
,
who
asked
all
the
questions
,
and
pretended
to
understand
the
whole
subject
.
The
Committee
treated
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
,
K.C.B.
,
as
a
most
distinguished
personage
,
whose
every
word
possessed
particular
gravity
and
value
.
He
delivered
a
set
speech
against
lenience
to
prisoners
,
and
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
Committee
.
He
was
about
to
sit
down
,
when
Mr.
Haggett
laid
a
folded
paper
beside
his
hand
.
Sir
Joshua
glanced
at
the
document
,
and
resumed
,
in
a
convincing
tone--
"
Here
,
gentlemen
,
"
he
said
,
touching
the
paper
repeatedly
with
his
finger
,
"
here
is
an
instance
of
the
sentimental
method
,
and
its
effect
.
on
a
desperate
criminal
--
and
all
those
who
are
sent
to
Australia
are
desperate
.
Twenty
years
ago
,
a
young
man
was
convicted
at
York
Assizes
,
for
poaching
.
It
was
during
a
time
of
business
depression
;
the
capitalists
and
employers
had
closed
their
works
,
and
locked
out
their
hands
.
Nothing
else
could
be
done
-
-
men
cannot
risk
their
when
markets
are
.
money
e
falling
.
During
this
time
,
the
deer
one
of
the
no
man
in
Lord
Scarborough's
park
had
been
killed
by
the
score
,
and
a
close
watch
was
set
.
This
man
was
caught
in
the
night
,
carrying
a
deer
on
his
shoulders
from
the
park
.
He
made
a
violent
resistance
,
striking
.
keepers
a
terrible
blow
that
felled
him
to
the
earth
,
senseless
.
The
poacher
was
overpowered
,
however
,
and
sent
to
prison
until
the
Assizes
.
At
his
trial
he
pleaded
defiantly
that
he
had
a
right
to
the
deer
;
that
thousands
were
starving
to
death-
-men
,
women
,
and
children
--
in
the
streets
of
the
town
;
and
that
God
had
given
the
right
to
herd
hundreds
of
useless
deer
while
human
beings
were
dying
of
hunger
.
The
ignorant
and
dangerous
people
who
heard
him
cheered
wildly
in
the
court
at
this
lawless
speech
.
Gentlemen
,
this
poacher
was
a
desperate
radical
--
a
Chartist
,
no
doubt
-
-
who
ought
to
have
been
severely
treated
.
But
the
judge
looked
leniently
on
the
case
,
because
it
was
proved
that
the
poacher's
own
mother
and
sisters
were
starving

prisoner
got
off
with
one
month's
imprisonment
.
What
was
the
result
of
this
mildness
?
At
the
Very
Assizes
the
same
judge
tried
the
same
prisoner
for
a
similar
crime
,
and
the
audacious
villain
made
the
same
defence
.
The
next

were
a
light
crime

months
ago
,
"
he
said
to
the
mistaken
judge
,
"
it
is
no
heavier
now
,
for
the
cause
"
If
it
