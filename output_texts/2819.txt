Bill
.
"
And
yet
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
with
all
y
your
enthusiasm
for
social
reform
,
you
!
have
given
us
a
bill
which
is
filled
with
practical
attention
to
existing
institutions
.
"
"
Ah
,
it
is
too
soon
to
begin
;
and
the
beginning
will
not
be
at
that
point
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
The
real
evil
is
outside
the
prison
,
and
at
present
our
legal
morality
calls
it
good
.
Until
society
is
changed
by
the
new
common
sense
of
abstract
justice
,
we
must
temporize
with
our
criminal
codes
.
"
There
was
a
pause
:
no
one
seemed
willing
to
break
the
floating
possibilities
of
the
future
.
are
you
"
You
are
going
to
Australia
with
the
next
convict
ship
,
not
?
"
Mr.
Hamerton
at
length
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Yes
,
I
wish
to
see
the
machinery
of
the
new
system
put
in
motion
.
Besides
,
I
have
personal
matters
to
attend
"
to
in
the
colony
.
"
Sheridan
had
started
so
sudden
at
the
question
,
that
now
all
three
turned
their
eyes
on
him
"
I
have
thought
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
Lord
Somers
,
"
that
I
also
should
like
to
return
to
Australia
on
that
ship
.
"
"
Would
you
not
prefer
to
go
in
my
yacht
,
Mr.
Sheridan
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
She
will
sail
for
Australia
about
the
same
time
,
and
you
shall
command
her
for
the
voyage
.
"
"
!
"
I
should
prefer
the
ship
,
"
said
Sheridan
.
Then
,
thinking
he
had
rudely
refused
,
he
added
:
"
I
desire
very
keenly
to
have
this
experience
.
"
"
You
shall
have
wish
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
Secretary
;
"
and
I
envy
you
the
companionship
of
your
voyage

a
prayer
we
enter
the
cell
of
Alice
Walmsley
--
a
cell
where
no
prayer
had
been
uttered
,
woful
to
say
,
for
eyes
that
,
during
With
the
first
five
years
of
her
life
therein
.
We
look
upon
the
calm
,
white
face
and
the
downcast
the
hopeless
period
,
had
never
been
raised
to
Heaven
--
except
once
,
and
then
only
in
defiance
and
imprecation
.
God's
hand
had
caught
her
up
from
the
happy
plain
,
to
fling
her
into
the
darkest
furrows
of
affliction
;
and
from
these
depths
the
stricken
soul
had
upbraided
the
judge
and
rebelled
against
the
sentence
.
as
Alice
Walmsley
had
been
born
with
a
heart
all
kindness
and
sympathy
.
From
her
very
infancy
she
had
loved
intensely
the
kindly
,
the
unselfish
,
and
the
beautiful
.
She
had
lived
through
her
girlhood
.
happy
,
healthy
,
and
pure
as
the
primroses
beneath
her
mother's
hedgerows
.
She
had
approached
womanhood
as
a
silver
stream
ripples
to
the
sea
,
yearning
for
its
greatness
and
its
troubles
and
its
joys
--
hurrying
from
the
calm
delights
of
the
meadow
banks
to
the
mighty
main
of
strength
,
and
saltness
,
and
sweetness
.
The
moment
of
communion
was
reached
at
last
,
when
her
girlish
life
plunged
with
delicious
expectation
into
the
deep
and
in
one
hideous
instant
she
knew
that
for
ever
she
had
parted
from
the
pure
and
beautiful
,
and
was
buried
in
an
ocean
of
corruption
and
disappointment
,
rolled
over
by
waves
of
unimaginable
and
inevitable
suffering
,
and
wrong
.
From
the
first
deep
plunge
,
stifled
,
agonized
,
appalled
,
she
rose
to
the
surface
,
only
to
behold
the
land
receding
from
her
view
--
the
sweet
fields
of
her
innocent
and
joyous
girlhood
fading
in
the
distance
.
She
raised
her
and
saw
the
heaven
calm
and
beautiful
above
her
,
sprinkled
with
gem
-
like
stars
--
and
she
cried
,
she
screamed
to
God
for
help
in
her
helplessness
.
The
answer
did
not
come
--the
lips
of
God
were
eyes
,
dumb
--
it
seemed
as
if
He
did
not
heed
nor
see
the
ruin
of
serene
as
before
,
and
the
stars
were
as
bright
one
puny
human
life
.
The
sky
was
as
beautiful
and
Then
,
from
the
crest
of
the
wave
,
as
she
felt
herself
slipping
back
into
the
dreadful
depths
again
,
and
for
ever
,
she
raised
her
face
to
heaven
,
and
shrieked
reproach
and
disbelief
and
execration
!
On
the
very
day
of
her
marriage
,
before
the
solemn
words
of
the
ceremony
had
left
her
.
memory
she
had
looked
for
one
dread
moment
beneath
the
mask
of
him
who
had
won
her
love
and
trust
--
some
old
letters
of
her
husband
relating
to
Will
Sheridan
had
fallen
into
her
hands
--
and
she
shrank
within
herself
,
affrighted
at
the
knowledge
of
deceit
and
habitual
falsehood
that
the
glimpse
had
brought
her
.
It
was
her
first
grief
and
