There

a
saying
in

he
added
laughingly
to
Mr.
Wyville

that
there

only

Come

ride

Perth

The
Governor

Mr.
Wyville
,
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
staff
moved
off
,
leaving
Captain
Draper
alone
in
the
centre
of
the
prison
yard
.
He
regarded
them
with
baleful
eyes
till
they
went
through
the
gate

disappeared

he
followed

emerged
from

THE
little
town
of
Fremantle
,
with
its
imposing
centre
,
the
great
stone
prison
,
is
built
on
the
shore
,
within
the
angle
formed
by
the
broad
Swan
River
as
it
flow's
calmly
into
the
calm
sea
.
At
its
mouth
,
the
Swan
is
about
two
miles
wide
.
The
water
is
shallow
,
and
as
clear
as
crystal
,
showing
,
from
the
high
banks
,
the
brown
stones
and
the
patches
of
white
sand
on
the
bottom
.
The
only
ripple
ever
seen
on
its
face
,
except
in
the
rainy
season
,
is
the
graceful
curve
that
follows
the
stately
motion
of
the
black
swans
,
which
have
made
the
beautiful
river
their
home
,
and
have
given
it
its
name
.
One
mile
above
the
mouth
of
the
river
,
where
the
gloomy
cliff
hangs
over
the
stream
,
are
situated
the
terrible
stone
-
quarries
of
Fremantle
,
where
the
chain
-
gang
works
.
Many
a
time
,
from
the
edge
of
the
overhanging
cliff
,
a
dark
mass
had
been
seen
to
plunge
into
the
river
,
which
is
very
deep
at
this
point
.
After
this
,
there
was
one
link
missing
in
the
chains
at
night
,
and
there
was
little
stir
made
and
few
questions
asked
.
Not
one
swimmer
in
a
thousand
could
cross
a
mile
of
water
with
fifty
pounds
of
iron
chained
to
his
ankles
.
For
ten
miles
above
Fremantle
,
the
Swan
winds
in
and
out
among
the
low
hills
and
the
wooded
valleys
.
Its
course
is
like
a
dream
of
peace
.
There
is
never
a
stone
in
its
bed
great
enough
to
break
the
surface
into
a
whirl
or
ripple
.
Its
water
turns
no
busy
wheels
.
Along
its
banks
are
seen
not
thriving
homesteads
.
Here
and

statue
,
while
his
wives
and
there
,
in
the
shallows
,
a
black
man

with

an

children
sit
upon
the
shaded
rocks
on
the
shore
,
and
silently
watch
his
skilful

Presently
,
without
a
quiver
of
warning
,
the
statue
moves
its
arm
,
the
long
spear
is
driven
under
water
like
a
flash
,
and
is
raised
to
bear
ashore
its
prize
of
a
wide
-
backed
plaice
.
Along
the
wooded
banks
,
the
kangaroo
nibbles
the
fresh
grass
,
and
the
bright
-
skinned
carpet
snake
dives
into
the
pleasant
water
,
that
has
become
almost
his
second
home
.
On
a
lovely
bend
of
the
river
,
ten
miles
from
its
mouth
,
stands
the
little
city
of
Perth
,
the
capital
of
the
penal
colony
,
and
the
residence
of
the
Governor
.
It

Just
outside
the
town
,
on
a
.
river
,
stood
a
long
,
low
building
,
within
a
high
enclosure
.
This
was
the
Convent
of
the
Sisters
of
Mercy
,
where
a
slope
of
exquisite
lawn
,
running
past
the
great
stone
prison
,
running
down
to

the
children
of
the
colony
were
educated
.
In
the
porch
of
the
convent
one
evening
,
some
two
weeks
after
the
arrival
of
the
Houguemont
,
sat
Alice
Walmsley
,
Sister
Cecilia
,
and
two
growing
girls
from
the
convent
school
.
"
Yes
,
"
said
Alice
,
in
answer
to
some
remark
of
the
nun
,
"
this
is
,
indeed
,
a
scene
.
of
utter
rest
.
But
,
"
she
added
,
"
sadly
,
"
it
is
not
so
for
most
of
those
who
see
what
we
see
.
There
is
no
rest
for
--
"
"
The
wicked
,
Alice
,
"
said
one
of
the
schoolgirls
,
the
daughter
of
a
free
settler
.
"
Neither
should
there
be
.
Why
da
you
always
pity
the
convicts
so
?
One
would
think
you
ought
to
hate
them
.
"
The
other
girl
stood
beside
Alice's
chair
,
touching
her
soft
hair
with
her
hand
in
a
caressing
manner
.
"
Alice
couldn't
hate
even
the
convicts
,
"
she
said
,
bending
to
smile
in
Alice's
face
.
It
was
evident
that
the
loving
nature
was
fully
alive
,
sending
out
already
its
tendrils
to
draw
towards
it
everything
within
its
reach
.
Sister
Cecilia
smiled
kindly
as
she
heard
the
girls
,
and
saw
their
expressions
of
love
for
Alice
.
She
,
however
,
changed
the
subject
.
"
Mr.
Wyville's
yacht
,
with
Mr.
Hamerton
and
Mr.
Sheridan
,
will
return
from
Adelaide
next
week
,
"
she
said
to
Alice
.
"
Here
is
the
report
in
the
Fremantle
Herald
.
"
Alice
turned
her
head
as
if
interested
in
the
news
.
Sister
Cecilia
continued
reading
"
And
then
they
wills
ll
start
for
Mr.
Wyville's
home
in
the
Vasse
.
"
Alice
silently
sank
back
in
her
chair
.
Her
.
eyes
slowly
withdrew
from
the
newspaper
in
her
friend's
hand
,
and
settled
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
Swan
,
in
a
waking
dream
and
a
dream
that
was
not
content
.
A
few
moments
later
she
rose
,
and
said
she
would
walk
home
early
that
evening
