The
two
men
passed
through
the
French
windows
into
the
dining

room
,
and
across
the
hall
into
the
library
.
"
And
my
daughter
has
been
living
in
Warwickshire

asked
Mr.
Mornington
,
as
the
two
men
took
seats
.
"
Yes
;
when
she
was
only
a
year
old
,
Mrs.
Neville
,
your
aunt
,
offered
to
give
her
a
home

and
she
has
lived
with
her
ever
since

I
have
seen
her
at
times

and
I
can
assure
you
that
you

will
have
every
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
.
But
here
she
is

he
added
,
as
they
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
passing
up
the
drive
,
to
the
hall

Mr.
Mornington
rose

Bring

had

No

Mr.
Woodruff
explained
matters
to
the
newcomer
,
a
young
lady
whom
he
assisted
to
alight
from
the
carriage
,
than
she
broke
away
,
and
,
opening
the
library
door
,
found
herself
face
to
face
with
its
solitary
occupant
.
She
advanced
no

further
for
a
moment
,
but
stood
as
if
spell
-
bound
,
gazing
with
a
mingled
expression
of
hope
and
timorousness
into
his
face
.
She
saw
in
the
man
before
her
all
that
she
had
taught
herself
to
expect
in
her
father
.
A
man
of
upright
and
even
majestic
presence
,
with
dark
brows
,
resolute
features
,
and
iron
grey
hair
,
whose
pale
face
,
together
with
a
restless
look
,
appealed
powerfully
to
her
sympathy
.
There
was
nothing
there
to
excite
her
apprehensions
;
much
that
appealed
for
her
love
.
She
remembered
that
,
at
last
,
the
one
great
wish
of
her
heart
had
come
to
her
,
that
she
was
face
to
face
with
her
father
,
and
furthermore
there
rushed
upon
her
remembrances
of
his
unhappiness
,
a
story
as
often
heard
from
Mrs.
Neville
.
Her
heart
throbbed
violently
.
As
the
spellbound
feeling
slowly
died
away
,
leaving
her
free
to
move
and
speak
,
she
crossed
the
groom
towards
her
father
,
and
stood
by
his
side
,
with
one
hand
laid
upon
some
tremulously
his
shoulder
,
gazing
up
into
his
stern
face
appealingly
,
waiting_waiting
for
.
responsive
action
,
before
she
dared
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
,
and
claim
from
him
a
father's
love
.
But
,
if
unconscious
of
her
gentle
touch
,
or
even
of
her
presence
,
he
stood
with
half
-
averted
face
until
gradually
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
,
and
a
pained
look
chased
the
smile
from
her
face
.
as
Was
this
the
meeting
which
she
had
so
often
pictured
to
herself
?
Was
it
thus
she
was
to
find
the
father
of
her
dreams
?
He
would
not
speak
to
her
,
not
even
look
at
her
,
but
kept
his
painful
.
Her
hand
slipped
from
his
shoulder
,
and
she
receded
a
step
.

if
the
sight
of
her
was
"
Will
you
not
speak
to
me
,
father
?
"
she
pleaded
,
with
a
sob
escaping
at
the
last
word
.
Slowly
he
turned
his
face
towards
her
,
and
he
opened
his
lips
as
if
about
to
speak
,
but
there
was
no
need
for
words
now
,
for
her
first
glance
had
shown
her
that
this
silence
was
from
no
indifference
,
or
embarrassment
.
It
was
purely
the
cloak
of
an
emotion

deep
for
utterance

,
strained
to
his
heart
in

passionate
embrace
,
and
he
now
was

.
After

he
disengaged
himself
and
led
her
gently
.
across
the
room
,
placing
her
in
the
armchair

drawn
up
to
the
fire
,
whilst
he
,
still
holding
one
of
her
hands
,
stood
on
the
rug
eyeing
her
.
"
You
are
wonderfully
like

in

tone

His
mournful
gaze
and
the
tremor
in
his
voice
brought
the
tears
again
to
Eva's
eyes
,
and
she
could
scarcely
answer
him
.
"
I
am
glad
,
"
she
whispered
.
"
I
never

,
that

"
many
years
Mr.
one
There
fell
a
long
silence
:
Eva
feared
to
speak
,
since
she
could
see
that
her
father
was
strongly
agitated
,
and
so
she
sat
still
,
leaving
her
hand
in
his
,
and
waiting
for
him
to
recover
.
On
his
part
,
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
her
presence
,
for
memories
of
the
woman
whom
he
had
loved
so
fervidly
,
revived
by
this
fair
daughter
,
had
seized
him
,
and
carried
him
back
into
other
scenes
,
amongst
other
people
.
Again
he
was
standing
on
the
lawn
before
that
ivy
-
covered
cottage
on
Thames
banks
,
drinking
in
the
intoxication
of
who
had
been
the
single
sweet
dream
of
a
wasted
life
.
He
almost
fancied
that
he
could
hear
again
?
Wakefield's
cheery
voice
,
and
the
merry
ripple
of
the
river
flowing
a
few
yards
off
;
the
night
breeze
,
too
,
gently
disturbing
the
leaves
.
The
faint
perfume
of
mignonette
and
roses
seemed
wafted
again
towards
him
.
He
thought
of
his
beloved
as
seen
then
,
in
her
light
.
t
summer
dress
floating
about
with
careless
grace
,
and
flashing
upon
him
glances
from
those
unrivalled
eyes
of
which
the
reflected
glories
even
now
made
his
heart
beat
fast
.
But
next
there
came
a
a
frown
upon
his
face
,
and
its
lines
,
2
harder
,
until
the
watching
Eva
could
see
that
unpleasant
reminiscences
were
stirring
him
.
Growing
full
of
fear
,
she
tightened
her
grasp
upon
arm
,
and
drew
him
towards
her
.
With
a
start
he
recovered
himself
,
and
the
frown
cleared
off
.
"
Forgive
me
,
child
,
forgetting
you
for
a
moment
.
"
He
smiled
down
an

his
her
so
lovingly
,
that
she
forgave
him
freely
.
After
all
it
was
something
to
remind
him
