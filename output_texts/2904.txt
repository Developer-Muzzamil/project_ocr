as

Few
people
possessed
a
greater
horror
of
what
are
termed
"
scenes
"
than
Godfrey
,
and
ever
since
he
had
received
Mr.
Woodruffs
telegram
,
he
had
been
looking
forward
with
a
nervous
dread
to
this
meeting
which
he
feared
must
result
in
one
.
But
now
he
realized
that
his
fears
had
been
groundless
,
and
that
his
pet
aversion
was
shared
,
in
an
equal
degree
by
his
father
.
This
pleased
him
,
and
he
answered
in
tones
which
for
him
were
unusually
warm
.
"
I
'
'

With
a
nod
,
he
left
the
room
,
and
the
grand
meeting
between
father
and
son
was
over
,
greatly
to
the
relief
of
bath
The
dinner
was
,
in
great
contrast
to
the
luncheon
,
a
most
animated
repast
.
Godfrey
,
who
was
in
high
spirits
,
allowed
them
for
once
to
carry
him
away
,
and
never
permitted
the
conversation
to
slacken
for
a
moment
.
Mr.
Woodruff
also
exerted
himself
,
and
,
finally
,
Mr.
Mornington
seemed
to
forget
for
a
time
his
reserve
,
and
talked
well
and
amusingly
.
Long
after
Mrs.
Neville
and
Eva
had
left
the
table
,
the
three
men
sat
over
their
wine
talking
mirthfully
,
Godfrey
told
quaint
anecdotes
of
college
life
,
which
appeared
to
interest
his
father
especially
,
who
frequently
capped
them
with
similar
reminiscences
of
his
own
.
Then
the
conversation
turned
to
hunting
,
fishing
,
and
shooting
,
all
of
which
Mr.
Mornington
appeared
to
understand
thoroughly
,
and
plans
were
discussed
,
and
made
,
for
repeating
the
feats
.
To
his
son
,
Mr.
Mornington
imparted
his
intention
of
participating
freely
in
the
out
-
door
pastimes
of
the
county
,
and
even
hinted
at
the
possibility
of
his
entering
Parliament
.
Godfrey
upheld
him
in
all
his
resolutions
and
approved
of
all
his
intentions
,
and
when
,
at
last
,
after
the
third
summons
,
they
returned
into
the
drawing-
for
tea
,
they
carried
their
animation
with
them
,
and
seldom
had
the
room
contained
a
merrier
party
.
It
was
late
when
they
retired
.
Eva
and
Godfrey
met
on
the
landing
"
What

?
"
was
of
f
course
the
first
question
which
rose
to
Eva's
lips
,
as
she
looked
anxiously
into
her
brother's
face
.

"

"
Think
of
him
?
"
repeated
Godfrey
;
"
he's
just
the
sort
of
father
I
should
have
chosen
if
I'd
been
consulted
.
"
"
Yes
,
but
don't
you
think
he
looks
unhappy
at
times
?
I
have
noticed
there
comes
such
a
dark
look
into
his
face
as
if
he
had
something
terrible
on
his
mind
,
not
to
be
forgotten
.
It
quite
frightens
"
All
fancy
,
"
said
Godfrey
.
"
I
haven't
noticed
it
myself
.
I
thought
he
seemed
pretty
lively
,
considering
.
Good
night
;
don't
look
so
seriously
out
of
those
big
eyes
of
yours

advice
and
a
kind
nod
,
Godfrey
went
his
way
to
the
Land
of
Nod
.
or
you
will
have
wrinkles
in
no
time
,
"
with
which
they
stood
side
by
side
at
the
breakfast-
"
Here
comes
the
first
of
the
callers
,
"
said
Mr.
Mornington
to
Eva
as
room
window
the
next
morning
.
"
Sir
Miles
Averill
.
I
thought
so
;
and
is
that
gawky
youth
with
him
his
son
?
"
"
Yes
,
that
is
Harry
Averill
.
How
early
they
are
calling
.
"
"
Old
Averill
meant
to
be
the
first
of
the
county
people
to
welcome
you
evidently
,
"
observed
Mr.
Woodruff
,
who
had
strolled
up
to
the
no
doubt
,
remember
.
"
one
pair
.
"
You
were
a
great
favourite
of
his
,
as
you
,
sa
Mr.
Mornington
nodded
and
left
the
room
to
receive
his
visitors
,
who
had
been
shown
into
the
library
.
Sir
Miles
advanced
at
once
to
2
greet
him
,
with
outstretched
hand
and
bluff
heartiness
,
trying
in
vain
to
hide
the
nervousness
which
the
necessity
of
saying
something
out
of
the
common
had
aroused
.
For
Sir
Miles
was
a
type
of
the
country
squire
now
rapidly
dying
out
;
a
better
hand
at
drawing
a
cover
than
at
making
a
set
speech
;
of
his
greatest
troubles
indeed
being
the
necessity
of
making
.
some
sort
of
a
a
one
at
the
annual
dinner
to
his
tenants
.
They
,
however
,
knew
his
weakness
and
took
compassion
on
him
,
that
the
moment
he
rose
to
his
feet
,
there
commenced
a
perfect
babel
of
cheers
and
"
hear
,
hears
,
"
under
shelter
of
which
his
few
disjointed
sentences
passed
unheard
by
a
single
person
,
and
he
would
resume
his
seat
with
the
pleasing
reflection
that
his
speech
had
been
a
completes
e
success
.
For
all
his
shortcomings
in
the
way
of
oratory
,
however
,
no
one
could
deny
the
heartiness
of
Sir
Miles's
welcome
,
and
though
the
set
harangue
did
break
down
ignominiously
,
he
did
not
attempt
to
patch
it
up
,
but
simply
grasped
Mr.
Mornington's
hand
and
added
:
"
Never
mind
the
rest
of
that
.
I'll
just
tell
you
!
I'm
glad
,
wonderfully
glad
,
to
see
you
home
again
,
and
have
