a
rifle
shot
r
Î±
rang
from
the
maintop
,
and
the
water
leaped
in
a
jet
of
spray
within
a
foot
of
the
basket
.
Next
instant
,
came
two
reports
,
the
basket
was
knocked
on
its
side
,
and
all
on
the
deck
of
the
convict
ship
plainly
saw
a
man
swimming
in
the
sea
.
One
of
the
bullets
had
struck
him
,
evidently
,
for
he
shouted
and
dashed
about
wildly
All
this
had
happened
in
a
few
seconds
.
The
shots
had
followed
each
other
as
rapidly
as
file
-
firing
.
At
the
second
shot
,
Mr.
Wyville
looked
at
the
soldiers
with
a
face
aflame
with
indignation
.
As
the
third
shot
he
shouted
to
the
soldiers
;
but
his
voice
was
drowned
in
the
report
.
rang
out
,
Next
moment
,
he
saw
the
levelled
rifle
of
another
soldier
,
and
heard
the
officer
directing
his
aim
.
Without
a
word
,
Mr.
Wyville
seized
the
long
and
heavy
marine
telescope
,
which
he
had
laid
on
the
rack
,
and
,
balancing
an
instant
,
he
hurled
the
glass
like
a
missile
from
a
catapult
right
into
the
group
of
himself
on
the
poop
for
soldiers
on
the
top
.
The
missile
struck
lengthwise
against
the
rifleman
,
and
knocked
him
towards
the
mast
,
his
weapon
going
off
harmlessly
in
the
air
.
Consternation
seized
the
others
,
and
the
demand
as
to
who
had
dared
assault
his
men
.
young
officer
began
an
indignant
and
loud
your
orders
before
you
act
"
Come
down
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
sternly
,
"
and
receive
The
subaltern
came
down
,
and
joined
Mr.
Wyville
on
the
poop
,
saluting
him
as
he
approached
.
"
I
was
not
aware
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
was
to
wait
for
orders
in
cases
.
of
mutiny
or
escape
.
"
This
man
could
be
overtaken
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Your
guards
allowed
him
to
.
escape
,
"
and
you
have
no
right
to
kill
him
for
escapings
if
the
law
had
no
right
to
kill
him
for
his
crime
.
"
"
As
he
spoke
,
he
brought
the
glass
to
bear
on
the
unfortunate
wretch
in
the
water
,
to
whom
a
boat
was
now
sweeping
with
swift
stroke
.
"
My
God
!
"
he
said
,
putting
down
the
glass
,
and
turning
from
the
officer
;
"
the
man
is
drowned
!
"
The
struggling
swimmer
,
spent
with
previous
exertions
,
had
been
struck
by
a
bullet
in
the
shoulder
;
and
though
the
wound
was
not
mortal
,
it
rapidly
spent
his
remaining
strength
.
Before
the
boat
had
reached
him
,
the
poor
fellow
had
thrown
up
his
arms
and
sunk
.
His
body
was
found
and
taken
to
the
ship
.
During
this
scene
,
Captain
Draper
had
come
on
deck
,
unobserved
.
He
had
passed
quite
close
to
Mr.
Wyville
as
he
spoke
severely
to
the
military
officer
.
A
few
minutes
later
,
when
Mr.
Wyville
stood
alone
,
the
captain
approached
him
.
"
Am
I
supposed
to
command
this
ship
,
or
to
take
orders
also
?
"
he
asked
,
not
offensively
,
but
with
his
usual
hybrid
smile
.
Mr.
Wyville
remained
silent
a
moment
,
as
if
undecided
.
The
recent
shocking
event
had
somewhat
changed
his
plans
.
"
You
command
the
ship
,
Sir
,
"
he
said
,
slowly
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
Captain
Draper's
face
,
"
under
me
.
So
long
as
your
duty
is
done
,
no
interference
will
be
possible
.
It
may
be
well
to
understand
now
,
however
,
that
there
is
a
higher
authority
than
yours
on
board
.
"
"
Captain
Draper
bowed
;
then
turning
to
his
chief
officer
who
had
heard
the
conversation
,
he
sailing
gave
.
orders
for
FACE
TO
FACE
.
THE
convict
ship
,
with
all
sail
set
,
before
a
strong
quarterbreeze
,
ploughed
heavily
round
the
South
of
England
,
and
then
spread
her
arms
like
a
sea
spirit
as
she
swept
majestically
towards
the
deep
southern
seas
.
No
need
to
moralize
afresh
on
the
weird
contrast
between
the
tall
ship
,
nobly
and
beautifully
breasting
the
waves
,
and
the
hideous
secret
she
bears
within--
Who
,
as
she
smiles
in
the
silvery
light
,
Spreading
her
wings
.
on
the
bosom
of
night
,
Alone
on
the
deeps
as
the
moon
in
the
sky
,
A
phantom
,
of
beauty
,
could
deem
with
a
sigh
,
That
so
lovely
a
thing
is
the
mansion
of
sin
,
And
that
souls
that
are
smitten
be
bursting
within
?
Who
,
as
he
watches
her
silently
gliding
Remembers
that
wave
after
wave
is
dividing
Bosoms
that
sorrow
and
guilt
could
not
sever
,
Hearts
that
are
broken
and
parted
for
ever
?
Or
deems
that
he
watches
,
afloat
on
the
wave
,
The
death
-
bed
of
hope
,
or
the
young
spirit's
grave
.
