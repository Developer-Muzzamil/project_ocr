then
he
took
up
a
little
glass
ornament
in
an
absent
-
minded
and
nervous
way
.
Mr.
Wyville
sat
silently
watching
him
.
As
Draper
raised
the
piece
of
glass
,
his
hand
trembled
and
his
face
worked
.
He
dropped
the
glass
to
the
floor
,
and
it
was
shattered
to
pieces
.
This
recalled
him
.
He
smiled
at
first
,
then
he
laughed
aloud
,
his
eyes
watching
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Well
--
I
don't
want
that
ship
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
don't
like
convicts
.
"
"
I
am
sorry
'
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
rising
;
"
you
were
highly
recommended
,
Captain
Draper
,
and
as
the
duty
is
considered
onerous
,
the
.
Voyage
will
be
quite
remunerative
for
the
commander
.
"
Draper's
cupidity
was
excited
,
and
he
seemed
to
hesitate
.
"
Do
you
i
know
anything
about
these
convicts
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Yes
,
what
do
you
wish
to
know
?
"
"
How
long
have
they
been
in
prison
?
"
"
On
an
average
,
about
three
years
.
"
years
any
to
be
sent
after
nine
or
ten
years
?
"
It
would
be
"
Three
did
you
ever
know
"
No
;
not
one
such
case
has
accurred
for
the
past
twenty
years
.
"
Yes
;
well
,
years
,
eh
?
"
you
Very
unusual
.
"
know
,
I
don't
care
about
them
--
but
I
have
a
curiosity
.
I
suppose
they're
all
right
--
all
about
three
"
That
will
be
the
average
,
certainly
.
"
"
Well
,
I
think
I'll
take
the
ship
.
Where
does
she
lie
,
and
when
is
she
to
sail
?
"
Mr.
Wyville
gave
him
all
the
particulars
;
and
when
his
questions
ceased
,
Mr.
Wyville
drew
out
a
set
of
articles
to
be
signed
.
"
You
came
prepared
,
eh
?
"
said
Draper
.
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
gravely
reading
over
the
form
.
as
well
to
save
time
.
Please
sign
your
name
"
We
were
anxious
to
secure
your
services
,
and
I
thought
it
just
here
--
and
here
--
and
here
.
Thank
you
.
'
Now
I
shall
I
say
good
-
day
Captain
Draper
.
"
"
The
ship
is
ready
,
you
say
?
"
said
Draper
,
following
him
to
the
door
;
"
then
I
ance
,
I
suppose
?
"
am
expected
to
take
command
at
"
No
,
not
until
the
day
of
sailing
.
Your
officers
will
see
to
the
preparations
for
sailing
.
At
two
o'clock
p.m.
,
an
the
10th
,
will
take
command
,
and
sail
.
"
you
"
Well
,
"
said
Draper
,
and
as
he
looked
after
the
strong
figure
of
Wyville
,
he
muttered
to
himself
-
-
"
Well
-
-just
as
years
.
well
,
they
only
average
three
KORO
AND
TAPAIRU
.
But
I'd
rather
go
on
board
at
once
,
and
see
them
before
we
sail
.
"
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
communing
with
himself
,
as
he
walked
from
Draper's
house
,
and
entered
his
cab
at
the
end
of
Horton
-
street
,
"
the
elements
are
moving
.
May
good
influences
direct
them
.
"
At
his
own
house
,
he
dismissed
the
cab
,
and
,
entering
,
with
unusual
gravity
greeted
Mr.
Hamerton
,
who
was
awaiting
him
.
"
You
said
in
your
note
that
you
had
an
important
business
communication
to
make
to
me
,
"
said
Hamerton
,
without
appearing
to
notice
Wyville's
mental
disturbance
.
Mr.
Wyville
did
not
answer
,
but
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
slowly
,
sunk
in
deep
thought
,
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
.
may
"
These
results
&
follow
,
"
he
said
at
length
,
evidently
thinking
aloud
;
"
but
there
is
need
of
an
intelligence
to
make
them
inevitable
.
Mr.
Hamerton
,
"
he
said
,
stopping
before
his
friend
,
and
fixing
his
.
eyes
upon
him
,
"
I
have
a
trust
to
offer
you
that
involves
a
heavy
responsibility
.
Will
you
undertake
it
,
for
my
sake
,
and
,
in
case
out
my
desire
to
the
letter
?
"
I
will
do
my
best
to
the
end
,
"
answered
Hamerton
.
what
may
come
,
carry
.
"
If
it
he
in
my
power
,
I
will
.
If
it
he
beyond
me
,
of
it
.
I
"
Yes
,
I
am
sure
grave
am
of
very
grateful
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
took
his
hand
,
and
pressed
it
warmly
,
with
still
the
same
look
.
He
then
went
to
a
small
but
massive
iron
safe
in
the
room
,
opened
it
,
and
from
a
drawer
took
twa
large
sealed
packets
.
"
Here
,
"
he
said
,
"
are
two
envelopes
that
contain
all
long
as
I
wishes
and
all
my
my
power
.
They
are
mine
,
so
am
alive
,
with
freedom
to
control
my
actions
.
Please
remember
well
,
words
.
In
case
my
of
my
death
or
disappearance
,
or
another
event
to
impede
my
action
for
those
who
depend
.
on
me
,
these
packets
belong
to
you
,
to
open
,
and
read
.
"
"
Have
you
'
written
full
instructions
therein
,
which
I
am
to
follow
?
"
I
asked
Hamerton
"
No
,
I
will
not
instruct
you
because
I
trust
you
as
I
would
my
own
soul
.
You
will
understand
,
when
have
you
me
this
?
"
read
and
you
will
act
for
the
best
.
Do
you
promise
"
I
do
,
most
solemnly
;
but
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
suppose
I
should
be
unable
--
suppose
I
should
die
before
your
trust
