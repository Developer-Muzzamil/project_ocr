When
her
health
was
quite
restored
,
she
had
become
valuable
to
the
physicians
and
warders
.
She
was
asked
to
remain
in
the
hospital
rather
than
to
go
back
and
work
in
the
cells
.
She
chose
the
hospital
,
and
entered
at
once
on
her
regular
duties
as
a
nurse
.
Why
did
she
choose
the
busy
hospital
,
instead
of
the
solitary
cell
?
Because
she
was
still
a
woman

God
was

,
she
could
not

that

was

,
for
she
still
felt
sympathy
for
her
fellow

Alice

the

of

pierced
her

There
lived
beneath
all
the

of
her
suffering
a
love
that
thrilled
her
day
and
night
,
a
yearning
that
never

,
a
memory
and
pity
of
unspeakable
tenderness
for
her
dead
child
.
It
was
grief
in

to

asked
to
