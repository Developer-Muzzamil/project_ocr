There
is
no
difficulty
in
connecting
this
revelation
with
a
mysterious
murder
at
Mr.
Mornington's
London
house
,
No.
6
,
Upper
Sleeke
Street
,
on
the
20th
of
November
,
twenty
-
two
years
ago
.
On
that
night
,
the
proprietor
and
a
friend
,
Mr.
Cecil
Braithwaite
,
left
the
house
,
and
no
intelligence
of
them
ever
came
to
hand
.
The
evidence
before
the
coroner's
jury
,
which
sat
on
a
body
found
in
the
house
,
implicated
o
one
or
both
of
the
gentlemen
so
deeply
that
warrants
were
issued
for
their
apprehension
.
Upon
this
burglar
murderer's
confession
,
the
Home
Secretary
was
communicated
with
,
and
its
corroboration
being
easy
and
immediate
,
we
believe
that
these
warrants
have
been
already
cancelled
,
and
every
effort
will
be
made
by
the
families
concerned
,
no
doubt
,
to
discover
the
fugitives
and
apprise
them
of
the
proof
of
their
innocence

This
was
the
article
which
seemed
so
much
to
interest
the
man
who
read
it
by
the
light
of
the
pine
logs
.
It
further
inspired
him
with
a
decision
,
for
,
after
he
had
put
the
paper
back
into
his
pocket
,
he
crossed
the
room

drew
a

,

tread
,

,
and
with
them
crossed
again
to
the
light

Here
he
glanced
rapidly
through
them
,
pausing
in
his

at
intervals
,
to
bestow
an
anxious
gaze

His

took
out
two
or
three
bundles
of
him

;
in
a
few
minutes
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
little
pile
,
and
carefully
thrusting
selected
ones
into
his
inner
pocket
,
he
replaced
the
others
precisely
as
he
had
found
them
.
Then
he
relocked
the
box
,
and
carefully
replaced
the
key
in
the
sleeping
man's
pocket
.
He
breathed
more
freely
now
,
if
the
most
difficult
part
of
his
task
were
accomplished
;
but
he
never
for
.
one
moment
relaxed
his
wary
watch
on
the
slumberer
.
He
dragged
out
a
pair
as
of
snow
shoes
from
a
corner
,
and
placed
them
in
readiness
for
use
by
the
door
;
wrapped
some
thick
furs
around
him
,
and
slung
his
rifle
.
across
his
shoulder
by
its
strap
as
if
about
to
leave
.
On
the
threshold
,
he
deliberated
for
a
moment
,
turned
back
,
and
tearing
a
leaf
out
of
an
old
pocketbook
,
yellow
with
age
,
wrote
these
few
words
:

and
I
put
it
where
he
knew
his
companion

find
it
when

he
shot
along
on

into
the
blackest

For
the
squire
of
Mornington
,
whose
return
home
this
day
was
such
an
event
for
the
sleepy
little
hamlet
,
not
only
owned
every
acre
in
the
parish
,
but
was
the
largest
landowner
in
the
county
.
Every
y
man
and
boy
in
the
place
was
either
tenant
or
labourer
on
his
estates
;
and
yet
twenty
-
three
years
had
passed
since
Harold
Mornington
had
visited
his
home
.
Little
wonder
,
then
,
that
his
appearance
should
be
such
a
source
of
excitement
to
the
good
folk
;
and
that
they
should

turn

Mornington
is
a
small
village
,
and
not
a
a
particularly
picturesque
one
,
although
there
certainly
are
some
points
about
it
worthy
of
admiration
.
For
instance
,
its
cottages
.
are
clean
and
well
-
thatched
,
and
its
lattice
windows
,
when
opened
,
disclose
.
many
cleanly
and
comfortable
interiors
.
Peep

one
of
them
-as
an
index
of
all
—
for
fashions
do
not
vary
in
Mornington
.
There
is
the
oft
-
scrubbed
floor
of
red
tiles
,
rather
uneven
in
some
places
,
and
with
a
crack
or
two
here
and
there
,
but
none
the
less
pleasant
to
look
upon
;
the

backed

drawn
up
to

fireplace
