wonder
that
Harold
Mornington
,
as
he
gazed
upon
it
,
and
then
at
the
landscape
beyond
,
knowing
that
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
all
was
his
,
felt
the
indifference
vanish
which
seemed
so
strongly
his
characteristic
,
and
fervently
blessed
the
chance
which
had
brought
him
back
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
home
so
magnificent
and
possessions
so
ample
.
And
yet
,
as
he
stood
up
arms

,
in
the
carriage
with
folded
.
gazing
around
and
below
,
no
expression
of
unmixed
delight
was
reflected
from
his
countenance
.
Exultation
there
certainly
was
,
but
no
settled
glow
of
happiness
,
as
might
have
been
expected
.
No
look
of
content
,
or
peace
,
or
thankfulness
shone
in
his
dull
and
expressionless
mostly
,
and
,
at
best
,
filled
with
an
anxious
troubled
light
,
perhaps
from
the
,
of
bygone
miseries
.
Mr.
Woodruff
,
his
companion
,
as
he
narrowly
watched
his
manner
,
decided
within
himself
that
Harold
Mornington
was
still
an
unhappy
and
disappointed
man
;
and
caught
himself

more
than

Wondering
what
hidden
griefs
he
could
treasure
so
deep
that
they
could
not
be
banished
,
even
at
such
moments
as
the
present
.
An
uninterrupted
silence
had
reigned
between
the
two
men
from
the
moment
they
entered
the
park
gates
;
but
,
"
It

Mr.
Mornington
resumed
his
seat

the
reply
:

to
me
is
that

said
the
lawyer
with
a
smile
.
"
Half
an

wired

Cameron
,

"
Further
conversation
was
here
rendered
impossible
,
as
the
carriage
turned
now
into
the
final
sweep
,
and
dren
up
at
the
hall
door
.
Mr.
Woodruff
,
who
had
acted
as
guardian
to
Godfrey
Mornington
,
had
always
kept
up
an
establishment
at
the
Abbey
,
so
that
,
as
the
carriage
drew
up
,
Mr.
Mornington
found
himself
greeted
by
a
formidable
assemblage
of
servants
,
who
stood
on
either
side
of
the
hall
.
From
amongst
them
stepped
out
the
grey
-headed
butler
,
fast
becoming
superannuated
,
the
first
to
address
his
master
as
he
walked
i
with
Mr.
Woodruff
by
his
side
.
up
the
steps
"
Welcome
home
,
Mr.
Harold
,
"
said
he
,
peering
up
anxiously
into
his
face
as
he
addressed
him
.
"
'
Tis
a
glad
day
for
us
to
have
one

the
old

here
again

"
"
I
thank
you
Burrows
,
"
said
Mr.
Mornington
simply
,
extending
his
hand
,
which
the
old
,
man
pressed
with
warmth
.
"
A

he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
retired
;

to
the

Dining

room
?
Well
,
it
aptly
be
called

.
The
walls
were

,
and
curiously
ornamented

piece
was
of
black
oak
,
carved
and
figured
with
exquisite
designs
.
The

opened
out
on
the
stone
balcony
,
from
which
steps
led
down
to
the

Fine

of

,
hung
.
the
walls
,
but
a
small
sketch
placed
exactly
opposite
the
an
door
,
appeared
to
fascinate
Mr.
Mornington
.
Looking
neither
to
the
right
,
nor
to
the
left
,
he
walked
straight
across
and
stood
gazing
up
at
it
.
As
a
work
of
art
,
it
was
inferior
to
any
in
the
room
,
but
though
the
execution
was
imperfect
,
and
the
style
crude
,
the
artist
had
succeeded
in
producing
a
striking
picture
.
It
was
the
likeness
of
a
woman
—
and
such
a
woman
!
As
he
gazed
,
Harold
Mornington
felt
his
thoughts
go
back
through
a
long
vista
of
years
to
the
first
time
he
had
ever
met
her
.
She
was
one
loved
so
passionately
,
that
even
now
,
at
the
mere
2
sight
of
her
image
,
he
felt
his
senses
reel
and
his
eyes
grow
dim
.
The
woman
whom
it
depicted
wore
a
riding
habit
,
the
long
skirts
of
which
were
held
in
one
hand
,
while
the
other
,
grasping
a
riding
whip
,
up
fell
gracefully
by
her
side
.
Her
figure
was
tall
and
perfectly
moulded
;
her
hair
fair
,
though
her
were
dark
;
her
expression
was
somewhat
spoilt
by
.
those
pictured
eyes
reason
eyes
and
brow's
of
intense
hauteur
.
And
yet
,
he
who
gazed
upon
could
remember
when
they
had
shone
,
though
not
on
him
,
with
a
tender
love
-
light
which
altered
the
whole
aspect
,
and
supplied
the
one
thing
wanting
to
make
the
likeness
perfect
.
There
are
some
women
whose
beauty
no
painter
can
adequately
portray
,
for
the
reason
that
their
principal
charm
is
an
ever-
varying
expression
,
changing
in
a
single
moment
from
love
to
anger
,
or
from
happiness
to
grief
,
but
beautiful
