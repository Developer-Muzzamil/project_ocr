Sister
Cecilia
had
put
one
arm
around
Alice
,
and
,
as
she
spoke
,
with
the
other
hand
she
raised
the
tearful
face
and
kissed
it
.
Then
the
flood
-
gates
of
Alice's
affliction
burst
,
and
she
wept
as
if
her
heart
were
breaking
f
sorrow
had
exhausted
itself
,
only
murmuring
little
soothing
words
all
the
Sister
Cecilia
waited
till
the
storm
of
so
time
,
and
patting
the
sufferer's
hand
and
cheek
softly
.
"
"
Nan
,
dear
,
"
she
said
at
length
,
as
we
are
kneeling
,
let
us
pray
for
a
little
strength
and
grace
,
and
then
you
shall
tell
me
why
you
grieve
.
"
eyes
,
with
a
simple
as
a
a
child's
Sister
Cecilia
,
taking
Alice's
hands
between
her
own
,
raised
them
a
little
,
and
then
she
raised
her
e
sweet
smile
on
her
face
,
as
if
she
were
carrying
a
lost
soul
to
the
angels
,
and
in
a
voice
as
and
as
trustful
,
said
the
Lord's
Prayer
,
Alice
repeating
the
words
after
her
.
Never
before
had
the
meaning
of
the
wonderful
prayer
of
prayers
entered
Alice's
soul
.
Every
sentence
was
full
of
warmth
and
comfort
and
strength
.
The
words
that
sank
deepest
were
these
--
she
repeated
them
afterwards
with
the
same
mysterious
effect
-
-
"
Thy
will
be
done
on
earth
,
as
it
is
in
heaven
.
"
She
did
not
know
why
these
words
were
the
best
,
but
they
were
.
"
"
Now
,
Alice
,
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
,
rising
cheerfully
when
the
prayer
was
done
,
"
we
are
and
with
our
go
an
sewing
,
and
have
a
long
talk
.
"
e
going
to
bathe
our
faces
Alice
obeyed
,
or
,
rather
,
she
followed
the
example
.
Sister
Cecilia's
unaffected
manner
had
won
her
so
completely
that
she
felt
a
return
of
her
girlish
companionship
.
All
other
teachers
of
religion
whom
Alice
had
seen
in
the
prison
had
come
to
her
with
unsympathetic
formality
and
professional
airs
of
sanctity
,
which
repelled
her
other
phases
Half
an
hour
later
,
Alice
was
quietly
sewing
,
while
Sister
Cecilia
sat
on
the
pallet
and
talked
,
and
drew
Alice
into
a
chat
.
She
made
no
ref
reference
to
the
grief
of
the
morning
.
The
cases
in
the
hospital
,
the
penitence
of
sick
prisoners
,
the
impenitence
of
others
,
the
gratitude
and
the
selfishness
and
the
many
.
of
character
that
came
under
her
daily
observation-
-
these
were
the
topics
of
the
little
Sister's
conversation
.
"
Why
,
I
might
as
well
be
a
prisoner
,
too
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
,
and
making
Alice
smile
;
"
I
have
been
in
the
poor
"
hospital
seven
years
.
I
was
there
two
years
before
you
came
.
You
see
,
I
am
as
white
as
a
prisoner
.
"
"
Yes
,
"
said
Alice
,
looking
sadly
at
her
;
"
it
is
not
right
.
Why
do
you
not
grieve
as
they
do
?
"
"
Why
?
"
answered
Sister
Cecilia
,
gaily
,
"
because
I
I
am
not
a
criminal
,
perhaps
.
I
am
like
you
,
Alice
;
I
have
less
reason
to
grieve
than
the
other
poor
things
.
"
Alice
had
never
seen
it
in
this
light
before
,
and
she
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
philosophy
of
the
little
Sister
.
But
she
was
affected
by
it
very
deeply
.
"
If
you
"
am
.
had
remained
in
the
hospital
,
Alice
,
"
said
the
nun
,
"
you
would
have
been
as
much
a
Sister
of
Mercy
as
I
â€¢
Do
you
know
,
I
was
very
sorry
when
you
left
the
hospital
.
"
Every
word
she
said
,
somehow
,
touched
Alice
in
a
tender
place
.
Was
the
wise
little
nun
At
any
rate
,
it
was
well
and
kindly
done
.
choosing
her
words
?
When
she
kissed
Alice
,
and
pulled
the
signal
wire
to
go
out
,
her
smile
filled
the
cell
and
Alice's
heart
with
brightness
.
She
promised
to
come
and
see
her
every
day
till
the
ship
sailed
;
and
then
they
would
be
together
all
the
day
.
"
Are
you
going
to
Australia
?
"
asked
Alice
,
in
amazement
.
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
,
with
a
smile
of
mock
surprise
.
"
Why
,
those
poor
children
couldn't
get
along
--fifty
of
them
.
Now
,
I'm
very
glad
I
shall
have
you
to
help
me
,
Alice
.
We'll
have
plenty
to
do
,
never
without
me-
fear
.
"
She
was
leaving
the
cell
--
the
warder
had
opened
the
door
when
Alice
timidly
touched
her
dress
and
drew
her
aside
out
of
the
warder's
.
"
I
i's
sight
.
am
not
a
Catholic
,
"
said
Alice
,
in
a
tremulous
whisper
.
"
No
matter
,
child
"
said
the
little
taking
her
face
between
her
hands
and
kissing
her
eyes
;
"
you
are
a
nun
,
woman
.
Good
-
bye
till
to
-
morrow
;
and
say
your
prayers
,
like
my
y
own
good
girl
.
"
Alice
stood
gazing
at
the
spot
where
she
had
stood
long
after
the
door
had
closed
.
Then
she
turned
and
looked
through
the
window
at
the
bright
sky
,
with
her
hands
clasped
at
full
length
before
her
.
As
she
looked
,
a
sparrow
perched
on
her
windowsill
,
and
she
smiled
--
almost
laughed
-
-
at
the
little
cautious
fellow
.
She
took
some
crumbs
from
her
shelf
and
threw
them
to
him
,
and
as
she
did
so
,
she
thought
that
she
might
have
done
it
every
day
for
five
years
,
!
had
she
been
as
happy
as
she
was
then
.
FOLLOWING
A
DARK
SPIRIT
.
ABOUT
a
week
after
the
incident
of
the
flower
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
accompanied
by
his
black
servant
,
Ngarra
-
jil
,
left
London
on
the
Northern
train
.
The
black
man
was
clad
from
throat
to
feet
in
a
wrap
or
mantle
of
thick
cloth
,
though
the
summer
day
was
bland
and
warm
.
He
settled
silently
into
a
corner
.
of
the
railway
carriage
,
