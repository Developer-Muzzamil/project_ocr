locked

Mr.

struck
a

,
and

silently
entered
.
A
word
in
his

language
from

him

were

and
joyous
as
the
sound

The
gentlemen
,
smiling
,
turned
to
the
draped
recess
,
and
there
,
half
shaded
by
the
curtains
,
peeped
the
dark
,
laughing
faces
of
the
Australian
sisters
,
Koro
and
Tapairu
,
the
grandchildren
of

That
Mr.
Hamerton
had
become
familiar
to
the
girls
was
evident
from
their
natural
and
unrestrained
conduct
.
A
residence
of
several
years
in
a
northern
climate
had
arrested
in
the
sisters
the
immature
development
so
common
in
warm
countries
.
They
had
matured
slowly
;
and
while
preserving
all
that
was
charming
and
natural
of
their
woodland
graces
,
the
restraint
of
another
and
a
gentler
mode
of
life
covered
them
like
a
delicate
robe
.
They
were
so
outlandish
and
beautiful
,
in
their
strange
and
beautiful
room
,
that
they
might
be
mistaken
for
bronzes
,
were
it
not
for
their
flashing
eyes
and
curving
lips
.
rare
As
they
sat
in
the
curtained
recess
,
greeting
the
gentlemen
with
a
joyous
laugh
,
there
entered
the
room
a
very
old
Australian
woman
,
followed
by
two
young
men
,
bearing
trays
with
several
dishes
.
These
were
set
down
on
a
low
square
divan
.
The
old
woman
removed
the
covers
,
and
with
quick
,
short
words
directed
the
black
men
to
place
cushions
around
the
divan
.
The
sisters
,
Kara
and
Tapairu
,
came
from
their
seclusion
,
speaking
in
their
own
rapid
tongue
both
to
the
old
woman
and
to
Mr.
Wyville
.
They
took
each
a
corner
of
the
divan
,
seating
themselves
on
the
cushions
placed
on
the
floor
,
Mr.
Wyville
and
Hamerton
taking
the
apposite
corners
.
The
food
,
to
which
each
helped
himself
,
was
a
savory
meal
of
boiled
rice
,
yams
,
and
rich
stews
,
of
which
the
Australians
are
very
fond
;

which
were
The
conversation
during
the
meal
was
wholly
in
the
language
of
the
sisters
,
so
that
Mr.
Hamerton
remained
silent

of

asked

.

as
The
girls
answered
,
if
they
were
a
single
thing
of
nature
,
by
a
silent
and
inquiring
look
.
It
was
hard
to
read
either
pleasure
or
pain
in
their
faces
,
or
anything
but
surprise
,
yet
a
close
observer
would
have
discerned
a
subtending
line
akin
to
doubt
or
fear
.
"
Are
you
not
glad
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
,
with
a
smile
of
astonishment
at
their
silence
.
"
Yes
,
"
they
softly
answered
,
in
one
breath
,
after
a
pause
,
but
not
joyously
.
"
Yes
,
we
shall
see
the
good
Te-

,
and
we
shall
find

.

are

.
"
The
old
woman
,
who
had
remained
in
the
room
,
chuckled
audibly
,
and
,
when
the
others
looked
round
at
her
,
laughed
outright
in
uncontrollable
joy
at
the
thought
of
returning
to
her
beloved
life
of
freedom
in
the
forest
.
More
rapidly
than
a
skilled
musician
could
evoke
notes
,
she
ran
from
treble
to
bass
in
voluble
gratitude
and
benediction
.
Then
she
slid
off
to
the
joyous
word
to
the
other
dusky
members
of
this
extraordinary
household

and
As
Mr.
Wyville
spoke
,
the
hidden
fear
became
plain
in
Tapairu's
face
.
She
looked
only
at
Mr.
Wyville
,
her
large
deer
-

eyes
slowly
filling
with
tears
.

sister
,
too
,
