faces
,
which
in
my
long
exile
had
become
almost
as
the
shadows
of
another
life
;
and
they
regain
their
pleasant
brightness
but
slowly
.
Sir
Miles
Averill
,
my
father's
oldest
friend
,
let
me
grasp
your
hand
!
What
,
you
,
Hamilton
?
I
never
hoped
to
see
you
again
in
this
life
.
Gentlemen
,
all
,
I
have
come
back
after
a
long
and
weary
my
sa
I
long
.
But
three
short
months
ago
exile
,
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
days
among
you
.
You
all
know
my
history
,
and
the
sad
misfortune
which
has
kept
me
away
from
native
country
.
never
thought
to
see
it
again
;
and
but
for
the
good
fortune
of
lighting
.
y
on
a
home
newspaper
,
I
never
should
have
done
so
.
But
fate
has
at
last
been
kind
to
me
,
and
I
am
enabled
to
spend
my
remaining
years
in
the
country
and
which
boyish
associations
endeared
to
me
.
Once
more
I
thank
trust
,
meet
often
in
the
future
.
"
among
the
scenes
you
heartily
for
your
welcome
.
We
shall
all
,
I
Harold
Mornington
with
a
sigh
of
relief
,
but
with
other
visible
emotion
,
resumed
his
seat
,
and
under
a
final
no
cheer
,
the
little
cavalcade
moved
on
.
The
carriage
turned
off
the
road
into
one
any
English
mansion
can
boast
.
There
are
picturesque
surroundings
;
and
few
more
of
the
finest
deer
parks
which
-few
.
more
beautiful
sights
than
an
old
English
house
with
perfect
specimens
than
Mornington
Abbey
.
The
first
approach
to
it
is
through
stately
avenues
of
oak
trees
which
lead
for
more
than
a
mile
through
:
&
scenes
of
wonderful
beauty
.
A
grand
expanse
of
sward
on
either
side
terminating
in
slopes
,
richly
wooded
,
and
in
the
valley
with
deer
browsing
y
on
them
.
Along
the
latter
winds
a
trickling
stream
,
which
often
.
crosses
the
smooth
drive
,
and
loses
itself
in
the
woods
on
either
side
,
only
to
reappear
and
present
tempting
views
of
huge
trout
leaping
to
the
surface
,
and
leaving
behind
them
long
ripples
on
the
stream
.
Then
the
carriage
began
to
ascend
the
hill
from
the
summit
of
which
are
charming
views
of
wooded
glades
and
fairy
dells
,
untenanted
save
by
myriads
of
rabbits
and
the
stately
denizens
of
the
park
,
who
bound
away
at
the
sound
of
the
wheels
.
Farther
still
,
are
waving
cornfields
,
bathed
in
the
golden
light
of
the
setting
sun
;
and
fertile
pasture
land
,
in
which
the
rarest

old

farmhouses
and

homesteads

and

sight
of
all

peeps
of
the
most
glorious
residence

can

commoner
Built
for
the
purpose
its
name
implies
,
in
the
reign
of
Henry
VII
.
,
it
was
during
his
and
the
succeeding
reign
one
of
the
largest
and
most
important
monasteries
in
the
south
of
England
.
It
was
tenanted
at
first
by
the
Dominican
order
of
monks
,
noted
for
the
severity
of
their
principles
,
and
the
rigour
of
their
discipline
.
Relics
of
the
tortures
,
with
which
these
monks
were
wont
to
chase
unholy
thoughts
and
worldly
longings
from
their
minds
,
are
still
preserved
in
the
narrow
cells
where
they
worked
out
their
punishments
.
After
the
Reformation
,
the
Abbey
passed
,
in
common
with
many
other
such
buildings
,
into
royal
hands
,
until
at
last
it
was
bestowed
by
Elizabeth
on
Sydney
Mornington
,
the
first
of
that
name
.
He
won
,
by
the
favour
of
a
Queen's
smile
,
that
fortune
which
the
gallant
commander
of
,
I
men
had
sought
for
in
vain
.
During
the
Civil
Wars
,
Mornington
Abbey
was
severely
treated
by
the
troops
of
the
Commonwealth
;
but
,
on
the
Accession
,
it
was
restored
and
enlarged
.
From
then
until
the
present
time
,
it
had
passed
in
an
uninterrupted
line
with
uneventful
story
.
These
Morningtons
were
a
quiet
race
,
and
for
generations
had
been
content
to
play
the
rtle
of
country
squire
and
county
magnate
,
and
had
not
sought
to
extend
their
influence
by
political
,
means
.
One
Mornington
,
three
generations
before
,
had
indeed
sat
in
Parliament
for
a
short
time
,
during
which
he
behaved
in
a
most
exemplary
manner
,
never
missing
a
division
and
never
once
opening
his
mouth
.
But
after
three
years
the
Parliament
was
dissolved
,
and
before
the
next
election
a
death
in
the
family
had
occurred
,
and
the
new
possessor
of
the
Mornington
estates
did
not
appeal
for
such
honours
.
Little
different
in
disposition
from
his
ancestors
was
the
present
Harold
Mornington's
grandfather
.
He
was
the
son
of
the
sixth
Lord
of
Mornington
,
and
was
the
first
to
marry
out
of
his
own
county
.
His
wife
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
Scotch
laird
,
whose
pedigree
was
as
long
as
his
purse
i
was
short
.
She
died
in
giving
birth
to
Harold's
father
,
George
Mornington
,
who
inherited
,
however
,
his
mother's
ambitious
temper
rather
than
the
contented
disposition
by
being
expelled
from
appeared
to
and
almost
singular
inertness
common
to
the
Morningtons
.
He
commenced
his
career
a
public
school
,
and
later
on
was
"
rusticated
"
at
Oxford
.
He
then
studied
for
a
short
time
at
Heidelberg
,
but
soon
returned
to
England
where
his
extravagance
and
wildness
broke
his
father's
heart
.
This
sober
him
,
and
,
when
he
inherited
the
estates
,
he
settled
down
quietly
,
marrying
a
clergyman's
daughter
,
and
spending
the
rest
of
This
years
in
seclusion
.
Their
only
child
was
Harold
,
whom
his
too
affectionate
mother
completely
spoiled
.
She
died
when
he
was
fourteen
,
and
her
husband
,
whose
latter
years
appeared
to
be
embittered
by
the
remembrance
of
his
early
follies
,
did
not
long
survive
her
.
At
fifteen
,
then
,
Harold
was
an
orphan
,
left
to
the
guardianship
of
Sir
Miles
Averill
,
his
father's
oldest
friend
,
and
Mr.
Woodruff
,
the
family
solicitor
,
for
whom
Mr.
Mornington
had
always
had
a
most
profound
respect
and
even
esteem
.
This
Harold
it
was
,
who
,
after
a
wasted
youth
,
ruined
by
y
one
rash
act
,
had
returned
after
an
absence
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
to
the
home
of
his
ancestors
.
The
last
summit
is
surmounted
,
and
Harold
Mornington
can
plainly
see
years
