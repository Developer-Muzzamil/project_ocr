of

And
though

had
An
apologetic
cough
from
the
prosaic
lawyer
,
who
wanted
his
dinner
,
and
thought
that
his
companion
spent
quite
long
enough
gazing
at
his
wife's
portrait
,
at
last
recalled
Mr.
Mornington
from
his
brown
study
.
and
the
two
gentlemen
left
the
room
.
upon
Dinner
was
over
,
Mr.
Mornington
and
his
solicitor
had
moved
their
easy
.
chairs
the
balcony
outside
the
dining
-
r
y
-
room
,
and
the
former
,
reclining
to
the
utmost
extent
,
and
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
seemed
enjoying
to
the
full
the
luxurious
ease
.
Conversation
between
the
two
had
not
flourished
,
the
remarks
which
Mr.
Woodruff
ventured
upon
either
falling
to
the
ground
unnoticed
,
or
provoking
merely
the
most
commonplace
rejoinders
.
Perceiving
,
therefore
,
that
his
companion
was
in
no
mood
for
conversation
,
and
contented
enough
in
the
degustation
of
the
fine
old
Lafitte
,
and
the
flavour
of
his
Havannah
,
Mr.
Woodruff
relapsed
into
silence
,
which
was
at
last
broken
by
the
host
.
"
My
daughter
will
not
be
here
until
eleven
,
you
say
?
"
He
looked
up
inquiringly
.
"
She
cannot
reach
here
before
,
and
it
may
probably
be
later-
-say
half
-
past
.
"
Mr.
Mornington
took
out
his
watch
and
consulted
it
.
"
Half
-
past
eight
.
Well
,
Mr.
Woodruff
,
there
has
been
much
in
my
past
life
,
and
especially
the
events
which
led
to
my
leaving
England
so
suddenly
,
which
must
appear
inexplicable
to
you
and
,
with
&
your
permission
,
I
will
devote
a
portion
of
the
time
to
explaining
matters
.
"
will
then
be
better
able
to
understand
the
course
.
of
events
which
culminated
in
such
unhappiness
to
me
.
"
The
lawyer
bowed
,
and
,
drawing
his
chair
up
a
a
little
closer
,
assumed
a
listening
air
.
You
"
First
of
all
,
"
went
on
Mr.
Mornington
,
"
before
I
begin
,
let
me
ask
about
my
children
.
Is
Eva
like
her
mother
?
"
"
She
is
considered
remarkably
so
,
"
answered
Mr.
Woodruff
,
who
,
although
he
could
not
see
his
companion's
face
,
could
tell
by
the
silence
which
ensued
,
and
the
slight
tremor
in
his
tone
when
he
spoke
again
,
that
the
reply
had
affected
him
.
"
And
my
son
?
"
"
Oh
,
he
is
the
image
of
all
the
Mornington
,
men
,
"
was
the
reply
;
"
exactly
what
you
were
twenty
-
five
years
ago
,
and
would
be
now
,
if
living
abroad
had
not
altered
you
so
much
.
A
fine
young
fellow
too
,
"
he
continued
admiringly
,
for
Godfrey
Mornington
was
a
favourite
of
the
lawyer's
.
After
another
short
silence
,
Mr.
Mornington
commenced
his
tale
.
sprung
up
"
As
you
know
,
I
was
an
orphan
at
sixteen
,
and
my
life
,
until
I
went
to
college
,
was
uneventful
enough
.
I
had
been
at
Oxford
about
six
months
when
I
met
Cecil
Braithwaite
,
and
in
a
very
short
time
there
.
between
us
a
strong
friendship
.
Who
he
was
,
and
where
he
came
.
from
,
I
knew
not
then
,
and
I
know
not
now
;
perhaps
it
was
the
mystery
seeming
to
surround
him
which
first
excited
my
fancy
,
and
unconsciously
attracted
me
to
him
.
However
that
may
be
,
we
speedily
became
inseparable
,
and
,
being
in
the
we
spent
all
our
time
together
.
One
day
we
received
an
invitation
from
an
old
coach
'
of
mine
—
a
Wakefield
—
to
spend
a
Sunday
with
him
at
his
house
down
the
river
.
You
will
excuse
my
passing
over
this
quickly
part
as
as
possible
,
as
it
is
exceedingly
painful
to
me
.
"
Mr.
Woodruff
bowed
sympathetically
.
"
We
"
same
college
,
Mr.
accepted
,
and
arranged
to
row
down
on
the
Saturday
afternoon
.
How
well
I
remember
that
row
.
It
was
the
middle
of
summer
,
just
before
the
Long
'
.
our
favour
,
and
with
.
•
very
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
the
year
.
Luckily
for
us
,
the
current
was
in
y
little
exertion
we
glided
along
,
every
little
while
taking
long
rests
,
and
letting
our
boat
drift
among
the
willows
,
while
we
refreshed
ourselves
with
a
smoke
and
claret
It
was
too
hot
to
talk
much
,
and
our
among
cup
us-
friendship
had
long
ago
reached
that
point
which
renders
it
unnecessary
for
two
fellows
to
talk
for
the
sake
of
talking
;
and
we
passed
time
in
idly
speculating
.
as
to
what
sort
of
place
.
our
friend
had
,
and
whether
we
should
be
obliged
to
go
to
church
next
day
.
The
hours
fleeted
by
—
too
quickly
for
-for
we
reached
our
destination
about
six
o'clock
.
It
was
one
of
those
charming
little
cottages
with
lawn
sloping
down
to
the
river
,
the
dwelling
itself
half
-
hidden
The
moment
we
saw
it
we
went
trees
,
and
covered
with
ivy
.
!
into
raptures
.
Our
host
was
on
the
look
-
out
,
and
we
,
having
tied
up
our
boat
,
went
with
him
into
the
house
,
and
were
shown
into
our
rooms
to
doff
our
flannels
and
dress
for
dinner
.
When
we
descended
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
our
host
met
us
at
the
door
,
and
we
all
entered
together
.
To
my
surprise
—
for
I
had
always
thought
Mr.
Wakefield
a
bachelor-
a
girl
was
in
the
room
,
and
we
were
introduced
to
her
as
his
daughter
.
Love
at
first
sight
is
,
generally
,
I
believe
,
supposed
to
be
a
mere
captivation
of
the
senses
which
seldom
forms
the
foundation
for
a
deep
and
lasting
passion
.
However
that
may
be
,
before
dinner
was
over
I
had
made
y
mind
that
earth
held
but
one
woman
for
me
,
and
life
but
one
object
,
to
call
&
va
Wakefield
mine
.
After
dinner
we
all
took
our
coffee
on
the
lawn
,
and
smoked
and
talked
,
till
,
after
a
while
,
Miss
Wakefield
went
into
up
my
