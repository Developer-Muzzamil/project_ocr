sharply
of
her
mother
.
That
alone
,
she
felt
,
would
in
time
gain
her
his
love
.
The
door
opened
,
and
Mrs.
Neville
and
the
lawyer
entered
.
The
interview
between
father
and
daughter
was
over
.
Mrs.
Neville
was
looking
forward
with
pleasure
to
meeting
her
nephew
again
,
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
his
seventh
year
,
hence
her
greeting
was
a
cordial
one
.
He
saluted
her
courteously
,
but
did
not
respond
in
the
slightest
degree
to
the
warmth
of
her
welcome
.
She
would
have
been
disappointed
but
for
the
kindness
,
even
the
heartiness
,
with
which
he
thanked
her
for
her
care
of
Eva
.
They
talked
pleasantly
enough
for
a
time
,
before
the
two
ladies
retired
,
Eva
taking
leave
of
her
father
with
an
affection
which
,
to
her
distress
,
seemed
almost
to
cause
him
embarrassment
.
run
younger
upon
her
Mrs.
Neville
,
whom
it
would
be
impolite
to
allow
thus
cavalierly
to
be
dismissed
by
us
,
was
the
daughter
of
the
country
clergyman
whose
elder
daughter
had
married
Harold
Mornington's
father
.
She
had
been
sought
and
won
by
a
well
-
to
-
do
country
gentleman
in
Warwickshire
,
whose
early
death
had
left
her
a
childless
widow
with
an
ample
fortune
.
She
it
was
who
volunteered
to
receive
Eva
as
her
child
mother's
death
.
She
was
an
ordinary
person
enough
,
with
a
good
-
humoured
face
,
of
weak
will
but
sound
heart
,
no
uncommon
combination
.
Under
her
care
,
Eva's
life
had
been
a
singularly
monotonous
one
.
She
had
spent
six
years
at
a
good
,
not
fashionable
,
boarding
-
school
in
London
,
which
she
had
left
about
two
years
since
.
During
the
interim
,
she
lived
with
Mrs.
Neville
at
a
small
villa
,
outside
one
.
of
the
large
towns
of
Warwickshire
,
to
which
Mrs.
Neville
had
removed
for
a
time
,
in
order
that
her
charge
might
have
the
advantage
of
masters
,
to
complete
her
education
;
an
impossibility
had
they
not
quitted
Mrs.
Neville's
quiet
country
p
home
.
She
had
been
kind
to
Eva
,
and
tried
hard
to
make
the
motherless
child
happy
,
and
in
a
certain
measure
she
had
succeeded
.
But
she
had
never
obtained
from
Eva
that
love
which
a
mother
or
father
could
alone
have
gained
.
For
Eva
had
a
vein
of
r
romance
in
her
character
,
deeper
than
the
ordinary
.
of
school-
girl
sentiment
,
and
her
best
and
truest
affections
were
all
engaged
in
a
passionate
pity
and
adoration
for
the
homeless
wanderer
whom
she
knew
her
father
to
be
.
His
sad
tale
,
however
toned
down
by
her
aunt
,
she
was
never
tired
of
hearing
,
and
his
wanderings
in
foreign
lands
she
often
pictured
to
herself
.
Her
brother
she
frequently
saw
,
and
although
they
were
of
exactly
opposite
temperament
,
and
shared
no
two
views
alike
,
she
loved
him
well
enough
in
a
placid
way
,
quite
sufficient
,
however
,
for
Godfrey
Mornington
.
To
him
effusive
affection
of
any
sort
would
have
been
affliction
.
When
,
therefore
,
the
news
arrived
,
in
that
short
telegram
from
Mr.
Woodruff
,
announcing
the
return
home
of
her
father
,
Eva
was
filled
with
hope
that
henceforth
the
void
in
her
life
would
be
filled
,
and
that
she
would
be
able
to
lavish
her
affections
living
parent
,
rather
than
a
shadowy
ideal
.
Her
one
t
thought
and
anxiety
,
which
showed
themselves
constantly
during
the
journey
to
Mornington
,
was
whether
the
father
,
on
whom
she
was
eager
to
bestow
so
much
stored
-
up
fondness
,
would
reciprocate
it
,
and
appreciate
her
devotion
.
Her
excitement
on
the
way
had
been
almost
painful
to
so
even-
tempered
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Neville
;
but
her
reproofs
fell
upon
deaf
ears
,
and
all
&
va
could
think
of
or
discuss
,
was
whether
her
father
would
really
be
one
to
her
,
and
love
her
as
fondly
as
she
was
prepared
to
love
him
,
and
did
,
for
that
matter
.
He
was
all
she
had
pictured
him
,
a
noble
looking
,
man
,
with
the
stamp
of
good
birth
indelibly
impressed
upon
him
.
Her
who
le
womanly
sympathies
had
been
farther
aroused
by
the
intense
sadness
in
his
bearing
and
countenance
.
She
had
found
him
in
all
respects
equal
,
in
many
superior
,
to
the
ideal
she
had
worshipped
,
and
yet
,
strange
to
say
,
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
disappointment
rankled
.
He
had
been
agitated
on
seeing
her
;
he
had
embraced
her
with
warmth
,
and
yet
there
was
a
latent
sentiment
,
on
a
undefinable
,
yet
none
the
less
existent
,
in
his
greeting
;
his
manner
had
cast
a
chill
upon
upon
her
impulsive
nature
.
Long
after
her
maid
had
left
her
,
Eva
sat
in
her
dressing
-
gown
,
leaning
back
,
and
gazing
mournfully
into
the
fire
,
deep
in
thought
.
She
was
trying
,
all
in
vain
,
to
transfer
the
affection
lavished
on
her
cherished
ideal
,
to
its
incarnation
;
her
substantial
father
who
at
last
was
found
.
"
What
do
I
expect
?
I
expect
more
?
"
she
mused
.
"
He
met
me
with
kind
words
and
ardent
greetings
.
What
more
can
I
up
so
long
own
sake
and
less
for
my
was
wrong
,
nay
,
unreasonable
to
imagine
that
at
one
meeting
all
the
love
I
treasured
.
could
leave
me
.
It
will
in
time
,
I
know
it
will
!
When
he
grows
to
love
me
more
.
for
mother's
,
he
cannot
help
but
win
it
.
How
he
must
have
loved
her
,
"
she
continued
dreamily
.
"
When
he
looked
eyes
my
up
as
I
entered
the
room
,
I
felt
,
even
then
,
that
the
glow
in
his
eyes
was
for
the
memory
I
recalled
,
and
not
for
me
.
Even
when
he
was
kissing
me
,
and
that
strange
absent
look
glazed
his
.
I
knew
he
was
trying
to
imagine
that
mine
were
her
lips
.
"
Well
,
be
it
so
,
"
with
a
little
sighâ€”
"
I
must
be
content
to
be
loved
as
my
mother's
counterpart
until
he
shall
,
I
grow
to
love
me
for
myself
.
He
will
some
day
,
"
she
concluded
,
"
and
then
I
shall
love
him
with
all
my
!
y
heart
.
"
Tired
out
with
her
journey
,
she
fell
asleep
with
this
consolation
.
In
the
meantime
,
the
two
gentlemen
sat
up
for
only
a
short
time
longer
,
Mr.
Mornington
responding
to
the
lawyer's
questions
in
monosyllables
,
and
making
no
attempt
to
renew
the
conversation
begun
on
the
balcony
.
As
soon
as
he
correctly
appreciated
his
companion's
mood
,
Mr.
Woodruff
bade
him
good
-
night
,
and
