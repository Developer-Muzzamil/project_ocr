of
the
man
,
are
in
very
can
lessen
nor
adversity
extinguish
.
The
outward
appearance—
nay
,
even
the
manners
many
cases
no
true
index
to
his
temperament
.
What
is
often
put
down
as
nervousness
and
coldness
is
frequently
pure
sensitiveness
,
whose
only
defence
against
the
hard
blow
of
an
exposed
life
,
is
to
envelop
itself
in
an
unnatural
reserve
,
which
speedily
becomes
a
shell
.
It
is
not
that
the
power
to
love
,
or
that
the
love
itself
is
absent
.
It
is
rather
that
,
through
sensitiveness
of
disposition
,
it
would
be
painful
for
them
to
show
it
;
but
it
exists
none
the
less
,
and
to
an
extent
which
ordinary
men
seldom
,
if
ever
,
show
.
This
sensitiveness
is
not
very
rare
,
reserve
and
stiffness
is
not
its
only
mask
.
A
wife
fancying
herself
neglected
by
her
husband
;
a
child
thinking
itself
slighted
by
its
parents
.
These
are
common
cases
.
Then
again
,
some
one
who
has
some
flaw
in
appearance
,
or
walk
,
or
speech
,
fancies
himself
or
herself
an
object
of
ridicule
for
such
as
these
generally
magnify
their
defect
until
it
becomes
a
very
nightmare
to
them
.
And
there
.
are
many
who
,
wounded
by
the
—
perhaps
merely
imagined
—
neglect
of
husband
.
I
or
parent
,
or
by
the
ridicule
or
excessive
compassion
of
friends
,
seize
upon
the
readiest
and
most
easily
assumed
mode
of
concealing
their
feelings
,
taking
on
them
the
mask
,
either
of
reserve
or
stupidity
(
the
latter
is
frequent
enough
)
;
these
render
themselves
in
time
invulnerable
,
but
at
the
expense
of
misconception
an
the
part
of
congeners
,
and
then
frequently
go
down
to
their
graves
with
their
noblest
feelings
and
natural
instincts
unknown
and
unappreciated
,
either
completely
stifled
or
partly
smothered
under
a
veil
become
impenetrable
.
However
this
might
have
applied
to
Mornington
in
former
years
,
·
when
he
rose
again
from
kneeling
beside
the
by
nature
stern
and
reserved
,
but
he
was
grave
his
mask
was
dropped
.
To
people
in
general
he
appeared
as
a
man
nevertheless
agreeable
enough
,
since
his
sternness
was
not
severity
,
and
his
reserve
not
impenetrable
.
He
could
,
and
often
did
,
talk
freely
and
pleasantly
;
and
although
he
never
became
a
"
popular
man
,
"
yet
not
disliked
nor
feared
,
and
was
ever
pointed
out
as
a
man
of
character
,
whose
rigid
morals
made
life
a
praiseworthy
one
,
and
assured
him
success
.
If
closer
observers
ever
noticed
a
restlessness
and
dissatisfaction
about
him
at
times
,
they
put
it
down
to
ambition
,
which
frequently
produces
such
symptoms
.
But
when
alone
,
secure
.
from
interruption
,
that
unsatisfied
look
would
change
into
one
of
alarm
,
as
if
his
conscience
was
reminding
him
of
hell
-
hounds
on
his
track
.
From
those
dark
eyes
.
I
pour
glances
of
fiery
hatred
,
and
savage
blasphemy
would
burst
from
frothing
lips
,
or
such
a
smile
play
as
the
torturer
might
lavish
upon
would
his
victim
on
the
rack
.
This
,
we
say
,
is
the
Harold
Mornington
when
he
resumes
the
mask
with
which
to
outface
the
world
and
confront
the
social
masks
all
wear
.
But
now
no
disguise
upon
!
him
,
as
he
stands
unwitnessed
in
the
home
of
death
,
with
tear
-
stained
face
and
distraught
aspect
.
At
length
he
rose
to
leave
the
place
.
Thereupon
the
tenderness
and
love
fled
from
his
face
,
as
if
falling
with
scorched
pinions
into
the
which
had
drank
his
tears
;
as
if
in
those
few
minutes
he
had
expended
the
accumulated
emotions
and
feelings
of
a
life
-
time
.
grave
His
briefly
lightened
face
grew
heavy
with
evil
passion
and
hatred
,
and
a
malignant
fire
shone
in
his
.
with
quick
and
determined
steps
he
stalked
down
the
path
.
eyes
,
as
"
Died
of
a
broken

heart
,
"
he
muttered
,
with
a
sardonic
laugh
,
looking
back
for
a
moment
into
the
little
upon
enclosure
,
which
the
shades
of
evening
were
rapidly
descending
,
and
Wreaths
Vaporous

like
the
phantoms
which
the
clowns
pretend
them
to

Alone

left
thus
to
die
by
the
villain
who
blighted

;
but
not

,
"
he
hissed
between
his
teeth
;
"
not
unavenged
!
"
"
So
saying
,
he
sped
down
the
little
hill
into
the
town
.
He
just
caught
the
last
train
to
L
—
n
,
where
he
had
slept
the
previous
night
,
and
on
the
next
morning
early
started
to
London
.
His
former
self
seemed
to
have
disappeared
;
for
he
who
had
heretofore
shunned
company
,
now
courted
it
.
He
travelled
in
the
same
carriage
with
the
editor
of
a
provincial
newspaper
,
and
a
country
clergyman
with
his
wife
and
family
,
and
he
,
of
all
,
men
,
chatted
affably
.
He
talked
politics
with
the
editor
,
and
having
run
him
into
a
corner
,
discussed
with
the
clergyman
theology
with
equal
aptitude
.
Finally
,
he
won
the
heart
of
the
reverend
gentleman's
wife
by
his
praises
of
her
.
rosy-
-cheeked
boys
.
"
A
man
of
the
world
,
"
thought
the
editor
as
he
quitted
the
carriage
;
"
a
clever
man
too
,
but
unscrupulous
.
"
"
A
most
agreeable
companion

decided
the

clergyman
and
his
wife
,
as
left
alone
in
the
carriage
they
collected
their
belongings

interrupted
the
fond
mother
,
as
she
gazed
admiringly
on
her
youngest
man
of
the
world
had
,
only
a
few
short
hours
before
,
dedicated
his
life
to
a
vengeful
purpose
,
which
the
one
would
have
regarded
with
horror
as
immoral
,
and
the
other
with
contempt
as
insane
.
Arrived
in
town
,
Mr.
Mornington
called
first
at
Mr.
Woodruff's
offices
in
Lincoln's
Inn
,
but
finding
him
out
,
went
down
to
Mornington
by
the
afternoon
train
.
He
had
telegraphed
,
and
found
his
daughter
at
the
station
