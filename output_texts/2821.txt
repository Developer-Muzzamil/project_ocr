Friends
!
What
had
they
to
say
?
Kindness
was
dead
.
Shame
had
no
existence
.
Sorrow
,
disgrace
,
infamy
,
what
had
she
to
do
with
these
?
But
they
had
taken
her

had
seized
her

With
bands
of
faith
and
love
and
trust
and
hope
,
Alice
Walmsley's
life
had
been
firmly
bound
to
all
that
was
good
and
happy
.
The
destroyer's
knife
had
severed
all
these
at
one
merciless
sweep
;
and
the
separated
and
desolated
heart
sank
like
lead
into
the
abyss
of
despair
.
Then
followed
a
blank
--
intermixed
with
turmoil
of
formal
evidence
and
legal
speeches
,
and
voices
of
clinging
friends
,
who
implored
her
to
speak
and
clear
herself
of
the
dreadful
charge
.
At
this
word
,
her
mind
cleared
-
-
she
looked
at
and
understood
her
position
--
and
she
refused
to
speak
--she
would
not
plead
"
not
guilty
"
when
charged
with
killing
her
own
child
.
Her
mother
,
broken
with
years
and
with
this
affliction
,
tottered
from
the
rails
of
the
dock
,
against
which
she
had
leant
,
and
sank
heart
-
broken
on
the
floor
of
the
court
.
She
was
carried
to
the
open
air
by
weeping
strangers
--
carried
past
Alice
,
who
never
looked
upon
her
dear
face
again
.
Still
she
stood
silent
,
tearless
,
but
conscious
of
every
act
and
relation
.
Anguish
had
changed
her
in
one
day
from
a
girl
into
a
strong
self
-
reliant
woman
.
To
her
own
soul
she
said
:
"
My
life
is
in
ruin
--
nothing
increase
the
burden
.
If
I
speak
,
another
will
stand
here
--
another
who
has
been
wronged
as
I
have
been
.
She
was
wretched
before
she
became
guilty
.
Let
me
undergo
-
-
let
me
never
see
the
face
of
ane
who
knew
me
,
to
of
the
past
.
Between
freedom
and

,
and
imprisonment
and

These
thoughts
never
became
words
in
Alice's
mind
;
but
this
was
the
mental
process
which
resulted
in
her
silence
in
the
dock
.
The
trial
was
short
--
she
was
found
guilty
.
Then
came
the
solitude
and
silence
of
the
great
prison
.
Four
white
walls
,
a
stone
floor
,
a
black
iron
door
,
a
heavily
barred
window
,
through
which
she
looked
up
at
the
moon
and
stars
at
night
--
and
,
enclosed
within
these
walls
,
a
young
and
beautiful
girl
,
a
tender
heart
that
had
never
throbbed
with
a
lawless
desire
,
a
conscience
so
sensitive
,
and
a
mind
so
pure
,
that
angels
might
have
communed
with
her
.
Shall
not
this
prisoner
find
peace
in
solitude
,
and
goldens

in
the
waves
of
pain
?
She
had
been
one
day
and
night
in
Millbank
.
The
severe
matron
or
warder
of
the
Pentagon
opened
her
cell
door
in
the
morning
,
and
handed
her
two
books
,
a
Bible
and

she
said
,
not
fiercely
,
but
firmly
,
as
they
fell
into
the
yard
within
the
Pentagon
.
She
was
reported
to
the
authorities
.
They
sent
the
Bible
reader
to
pray
with
her
,
in
the
cell
,
according
to
the
rule
laid
down
in
convict
prisons
,
but
she
remained
silent
.
They

Her
case
was
brought
before
the
Chief
Director
,
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
.
This
disciplinarian
visited
her
dark
cell
,
and
,
with
a
harsh
"
Ho
,
there
!
"
flashed
a
brilliant
lamp
.
on
the
entombed
wretch
.
She
sat
on
a
low
seat
in
the
centre
of
the
dark
cell
,
her
face
bowed
into
her
hands
,
perhaps
to
shut
out
the
painfully
sudden
glare
.

said
the

,
looking
at

figure
that

"

He
evidently
took
a
special
interest
in
this
case
.
An
