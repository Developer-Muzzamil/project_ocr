There
was
no
other
way
to
have
a
wild
time
.
In
a
free
country
,
men
who
have
honest
maney
and
want
to
spend
it
may
do
as
they
please
.
But
,
in
West
Australia
,
the
freehanded
,
and
,
for
the
time
,
wealthy
ticket
-
of-
care
that
neither
he
nor
his
companions
are
noisy
or
leave
man
,
can
only
drink
and
treat
with
drink
,
taking
.
violent
or
otherwise
ostentatious
.
The
first
sign
of
disturbance
is
terribly
checked
by
the
police
.
of
Draper's
introduction
to
this
strange
company
was
most
favourable
to
him
.
He
was
known
to
be
the
captain
of
the
convict
ship
;
and
every
frequenter
of
"
The
Red
Hand
"
was
ready
to
treat
him
with
respect
.
This
is
one
the
unexpected
purities
of
convict
life
;
it
never
loses
its
respect
for
honour
and
honesty
.
But
Draper
!
had
no
power
to
keep
this
respect
.
In
the
first
place
,
he
did
not
believe
in
its
existence
;
he
was
too
shallow
and
mean
of
nature
to
think
that
these
rugged
fellows
were
other
than
vicious
rascals
all
through
,
who
sneered
at
morality
.
He
felt
o
a
sense
of
relief
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
among
them
,
as
if
he
had
at
last
escaped
from
the
necessity
of
keeping
up
a
pretence
of
honesty
or
any
other
virtue
.
very
Acting
under
this
conviction
,
Draper
let
loose
his
real
nature
in
the
convicts
'
tavern
.
He
did
not
drink
deeply
,
because
he
was
not
able
;
but
he
talked
endlessly
.
He
joined
group
after
group
of
carousing
wood-
cutters
,
keeping
up
a
stream
of
ribaldry
and
depravity
,
until
,
after
a
few
days
'
experience
,
the
roughest
convicts
in
the
place
looked
at
him
with
disappointment
and
aversion
.
Traper
.
Then
a
rumour
crept
to
the
inn
,
a
story
that
was
left
behind
by
the
sailors
of
the
Houguemont
,
of
Harriet's
confession
on
board
ship
,
exposing
the
heartless
villainy
of
Dr
4.
When
this
new's
became
current
at
the
inn
,
the
ticket
-
of
-
leave
men
.
regarded
Draper
with
stern
faces
,
and
no
man
spoke
to
him
or
drank
with
him
.
One
evening
he
approached
a
group
of
familiar
loungers
,
making
.
some
ingratiatory
remark
.
No
one
answered
,
but
all
conversation
ceased
,
the
men
sitting
in
grim
silence
over
their
glasses
.
"
Why
,
mates
,
you're
Quakers
,
"
said
Draper
,
rallying
them
.
"
We
'
"
'
re
no
mates
of
yours
,
"
growled
a
big
fellow
,
with
a
mahogany
face
.
"
And
we
don't
want
to
be
,
"
said
a
slighter
and
younger
man
,
with
pronounced
emphasis
.
"
Why
,
what's
the
matter
?
"
asked
Draper
,
in
a
surprised
and
injured
tone
.
"
Have
I
done
anything
to
offend
you
fellow's
?
Have
I
unconsciously
said
something
to
hurt
t
your
feelings
by
alluding
to
your
-
-
'
"
Shut
up
,
you
miserable
rat
,
"
cried
one
.
of
the
convicts
,
starting
to
his
feet
indignantly
;
"
you
couldn't
hurt
our
feelings
by
any
of
your
sneaking
allusions
.
We're
not
afraid
to
hear
found
out
what
nor
say
Do
what
we
are
;
but
we
have
just
you
understand
?
We
are
men
,
but
you
are
a
cowardly
hound
.
"
t
you
are
,
and
we
want
you
never
to
speak
to
us
again
.
though
we
are
convicts
,
and
we
only
want
to
talk
to
men
;
Draper's
jaw
had
fallen
as
he
listened
;
but
he
backed
from
the
table
,
and
gained
confidence
as
he
remembered
that
these
men
were
wholly
at
the
mercy
of
the
police
,
and
would
not
dare
go
any
further
.
"
You
are
an
v
insolent
jail
-
bird
,
"
he
said
to
the
speaker
;
"
I'll
see
to
you
within
an
hour
'
At
this
,
one
of
the
men
who
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
nearest
Draper
,
leant
towards
him
,
and
,
taking
his
glass
from
the
table
,
cast
its
contents
into
his
face
.
"
Get
out
!
"
he
said
;
and
,
without
noticing
him
further
,
the
ticket
-
of
-
leave
men
resumed
their
conviviality
.
Burning
with
wrath
,
Draper
left
the
tavern
,
and
walked
rapidly
down
the
street
towards
the
police
station
.
As
he
left
the
inn
,
a
tall
man
,
who
had
sat
at
a
side
table
unnoticed
,
rose
and
followed
him
.
Half
way
down
the
street
he
overtook
him
.
"
Hello
,
Preacher
!
"
said
Draper
,
giving
a
side
glance
of
dislike
at
the
man
,
and
increasing
his
speed
to
pass
him
.
But
Mr.
Haggett
,
for
it
was
he
,
easily
kept
by
his
shoulder
,
and
evidently
meant
to
stay
there
.
"
Hello
,
Pilferer
!
"
retorted
Haggett
,
with
a
movement
of
the
lip
that
was
expressive
and
astonishing
slackened
his
pace
at
once
,
but
he
did
not
stop
..
â€¢
He
glanced
furtively
at
Haggett
,
wondering
what
he
Draper
meant
.
Haggett
ploughed
along
but
said
no
more
.
"
What
title
was
that
you
gave
me
?
"
asked
D
the
timid
Scripture-
"
You
addressed
me
"
your
present
one
.
"
"
What
do
-reader
.
Draper
,
plucking
up
courage
as
he
thought
of
the
friendlessness
of
by
my
past
profession
,
"
answered
Haggett
,
looking
straight
ahead
,
"
and
I
called
you
mean
,
you
.
Mr.
Haggett's
bony
band
on
!
miserable--
suggestiveness
.
Haggett
then
let
him
Draper's
collar
closed
the
go
,
making
no
with
a
grip
of
prodigious
power
and
query
a
further
reference
to
the
interrupted
offence
.
"
You're
going
to
report
those
men
at
the
tavern
,
are
you
?
"
asked
Haggett
.
"
I
am
--
the
scoundrels
.
I'll
teach
them
to
respect
a
free
:
"
Why
are
they
not
free
men
?
"
man
"
Why
?
Because
they're
convicted
robbers
and
murderers
,
and
-

"
I
you
by
"
Yes
;
because
they
were
found
out
.
Well
,
I'll
go
.
with
you
to
the
station
,
and
have
another
thief
discovered
.
