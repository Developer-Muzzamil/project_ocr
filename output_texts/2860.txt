The
sick
prisoner
was
there
before
him
.
The
doctor
examined
him
,
quietly
ordered
his
treatment
,
and
retired
.
He
joined
Mr.
Wyville
on
the
poop
"
We
have
the
fever
on
board
,
"
he
said
in
a
low
voice
.
"
A
man
has
been
attacked
by
the
worst
symptoms
.
"
An
hour
later
two
more
convicts
complained
of
sickness
.
They
were
taken
from
the
hold
and
placed
in
the
cell
forward
.
Next
day
it
was
known
throughout
the
ship
that
the
fever
which
the
sailors
and
convicts
called
"
the
black
"
vomit
,
"
was
on
board
;
and
before
nightfall
thirty
prisoners
were
seized
.
The
sick
were
taken
away
from
the
hold
at
first
;
but
this
separation
had
soon
to
be
abandoned
.
There
was
no
apart
The
hospital
was
full

Those
who
took
the
fever
had
to

stricken
fellow's
Like
an
angel
of
comfort
,
Sister
Cecilia
tended
on
the
sufferers
.
Following
her
steps
,
and
quietly
obeying
her
word
,
went
Mr.
Haggett
.
In
the
female
compartment
,
where
twelve
prisoners
lay
with
the
fever
,
Alice
Walmsley
moved
ceaselessly
in
the
work
of
mercy
.
On
the
third
day
,
the
chief
officer
of
the
ship
said
to
Mr.
Wyville
--
"
Captain
Draper
has
the
fever
.
"
The
doctor
,
shortly
after
,.
came
from
the
captain's
room
,
and
reported
that
Draper
had
,
indeed
,
been
seized
,
but
with
symptoms
of
less
virulence
than
the
others
.
"
Who
will
attend
on
Captain
Draper
?
"
asked
the
doctor
.
"
He
will
be
unconscious
in
another
hour
,
and
will
need
care
.
"
"
I
will
attend
him

"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
after
a
pause
;
"
write
your

,
and
I
will

HUSBAND
AND
WIFE

HIDEOUS
incidents
filled
the
days
and
nights
as
the
convict
ship
sailed
southward
with
her
burden
of
disease
and
death
.
The
mortality
among
the
convicts
was
frightful
.
Weakened
and
depressed
by
the
long
drought
,
the
continuous
heat
,
and
the
poisonous
atmosphere
,
they
succumbed
to
the
fever
in
its
first
stages
.
The
dead
were
laid
in
a
row
on
the
port
side
,
as
they
were
carried
from
the
hold
.
Relays
of
sailors
worked
at
the
shrouding
and
burial
.
The
bodies
were
wrapped
in
sail
-
cloth
with
a
cannon
ball
tied
at
the
feet
.
As
each
corpse
was
hastily
shrouded
,
it
was
passed
forward
,
and
the
ghastly
roll
was
committed
to
the
deep
.
There
was
no
time
for
ceremony
;
but
Mr.
Haggett
,
as
often
as
he
could
be
spared
from
the
hold
,
stood
beside
the
opening
in
the
rail
,
where
the
bodies
were
launched
,
and
followed
each
dull
plunge
with
a
word
of
prayer
.
"
Mr.
Sheridan
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
as
he
came
from
Captain
Draper's
room
on
the
first
night
of
his
illness
,
"
will
I
take
command
of
the
ship
until
the
captain's
recovery
?
"
you
Sheridan
assented
;
and
Mr.
Wyville
,
calling
the
ship's
officers
to
the
poop
,
instructed
them
to
obey
Captain
Sheridan
as
the
commander
of
the
vessel
.
As
soon
as
Sheridan
took
command
,
he
spread
every
inch
of
canvas
the
ship
could
before
the
wind
.
carry
and
held
her
"
We
shall
shake
off
this
fever
when
we
clear
the
Southern
tropics
,
"
he
said
to
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
The
cold
wind
round
the
Cape
will
kill
it
in
an
hour
.
"
Captain
Draper
lay
in
his
stateroom
,
half
comatose
,
muttering
incoherent
words
in
the
low
delirium
of
the
fever
.
By
his
side
sat
Mr.
Wyville
,
giving
him
now
and
again
the
medicines
prescribed
.
The
sick
man's
face
was
a
ghastly
sight
.
The
offensiveness
of
the
protruding
,
eyes
and
cracked
lips
was
hideously
exaggerated
.
And
as
he
lay
smouldering
in
the
slow
fire
of
the
sickness
,
he
muttered
things
even
more
repulsive
than
his
physical
appearance
.
The
female
hospital
of
the
ship
was
filled
with
sufferers
,
indeed
,
the
entire
hold
of
the
vessel
was
at
once
an
hospital
and
charnel
-
house
.
There
were
no
regular
attendants
among
the
male
convicts
,
those
who
had
not
been
attacked
waited
on
those
who
had
,
till
their
own
turn
came
.
In
the
female
compartment
,
which
was
separated
from
the
regular
hospital
,
Alice
Walmsley
had
entire
charge
.
Her
healthy
life
enabled
her
to
bear
an
extraordinary
strain
;
day
and
night
she
was
ministering
to
the
stricken
,
and
they
blessed
her
with
words
and
looks
as
she
passed
from
sufferer
to
sufferer
.
on
the
floor
,
The
door
leading
thence
to
the
hospital
Sister
Cecilia
kept
locked
,
and
she
herself
carried
the
key
.
Sister
Cecilia
stood
one
day
within
the
hospital
,
at
the
door
of
a
small
room
.
Kneeling
before
her
,
with
streaming
eyes
and
upraised
hands
,
as
if
praying
for
a
life
,
was
a
woman
,
in
the
grey
dress
of
a
convict
.
"
O
,
for
God's
sake
let
me
tend
them
!
O
,
don't
deny
y
me
-
-
let
me
go
and
wait
on
the
poor
sufferers
.
My
heart
is
breaking
when
I
think
that
I
might
be
doing
g
some
good
.
Don't
refuse
-
-O
,
don't
refuse
me
..
I
feel
that
God
would
pardon
me
if
I
could
work
out
my
life
caring
for
others
.
