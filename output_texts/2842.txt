She
must
be
cleared
by
the
confession
of
the
criminal
,
and
then
we
shall
send
her
case
to
the
Queen
.
"
"
Well
,
"
said
the
governor
,
"
but
how
are
you
to
get
the
confession
?
"
"
This
woman
,
Harriet
Draper
,
will
come
to
Millbank
within
two
weeks
.
If
she
does
not
confess
before
the
convict
ship
sails
,
she
must
be
sent
to
West
Australia
next
month
.
"
"
We
never
send
convicts
in
their
first
year

said
the
governor
.
"
She
must

Mr.
Wyville

warmly
;

"
I'll
break
it
for
your
sake
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
said
the
"
I
shall
put
her
name
on
the
roll
.
"
And
she
must
be
kept
aloof
from
the
others
.
Can
this
be
done
?
"
"
Yes
,
we
can
enter
her
on
the
hospital
list
,
and
send
her
before
the
others
to
the
ship
.
She
will
be
confined
on
board
in
the
hospital
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
held
out
his
hand
to
the
governor
.
"
I
thank
you
sincerely
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
am
deeply
interested
in
this
case
.
"
"
When
he
had
gane
the
bluff
old
major
walked
up
and
down
his
office
,
and
mopped
his
head
with
his
big
handkerchief
"
It's
like
good
health
and
a
good
conscience
to
come
near
that
man
,
"
he
said
to
himself
.
"
How
strange
it
is
that
he
should
have
such
deadly
enemies
!

A
CAPTAIN
FOR
THE
HOUGUEMONT
.
IN
Mr.
Wyville's
house
,
in
the
library
or
study
,
sat
Mr.
Hamerton
.
He
had
been
writing
for
hours
.
On
the
table
beside
him
lay
a
heap
of
documents
,
with
large
red
seals
,
like
title
-
deeds
;
and
in
another
heap
lay
a
number
of
letters
,
addressed
and
stamped
.
Mr.
Wyville
entered
,
and
they
talked
for
s
some
minutes
in
a
serious
vein
.
It
was
evident
that
Mr.
Hamerton
was
engaged
in
some
more
important
business
than
usual
,
and
that
he
had
advised
with
Mr.
Wyville
during
its
progress
.
Lord
Somers
called
,
as
usual
,
on
his
way
to
the
Department
,
and
shortly
afterwards
Sheridan
arrived
.
Mr.
Hamerton
continued
to
write
,
and
a
cursory
conversation
began
,
the
gentlemen
glancing
at
the
papers
.
An
exclamation
from
Lord
Somers
broke
the
commonplace
.
morning
"
Hello
!
What
the
deuce
!
Why
,
Hamerton
,
this
must
be
&
your
place
.
Are
you
going
to
sell
Broadwood
?
"
"
Yes
,
"
said
Hamerton
,
and
he
went
on
with
his
Writing
"
The
whole
estate
and
manor
house
?
"
asked
the
peer
,
in
plain
astonishment
.
paper
"
The
whole
thing
,
"
said
Hamerton
,
in
the
same
prosaic
tone
.
Will
Sheridan
took
the
and
read
the
advertisement
:
Magnificent
and
historic
demesne
and

-400

of
Broadwood
-
-
valuable
church
living-
-antique
furniture
,
pictures
,

,
etc.
-
-
in
a
word
,
the
entire
surroundings
of
an
English
aristocrat
of
the
first
standing
,
advertised
in
the
daily
papers
to
be
sold
by
auction
,
not
as
a
whole
,
but
in
laots
.
purchaser
?
"
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
asked
Lord
Somers
.
"
Why
not
sell
the
right
to
one
"
Because
he
couldn't
buy
it
,
"
answered
the
stolid
Hamerton
,
who
was
in
a
mood
for
apophthegms
.
"
What
!
You
want
too
much
money
for
it
?
"
"
No
,
I
do
not
.
"
"
Come
,
come
,
"
Hamerton
,
this
is
unkind
.
Your
place
is
close
to
mine
,
and
I
independent
of
my
sincere
interest
in
"
Well
,
as
your
affairs
.
"
am
naturally
interested
,
you
spoke
of
buying
the
right
.
Now
,
Somers
,
no
one
man
could
buy
or
hold
the
right
to
so
much
land
only
a
few
rich
Broadwood
in
this
populous
and
poverty
-
stricken
country
--
yes
,
poverty
stricken
:
there
are
people
.
Eighty
out
of
every
hundred
are
miserably
poor
.
The
best
a
rich
man
could
do
would
be
to
buy
the
title
-
deeds
;
but
the
abstract
right
of
ownership
would
remain
with
the
farmers
who
tilled
the
land
.
"
"
I
don't
understand
you
,
"
said
Lord
Somers
.
"
I
propose
to
sell
the
deeds
to
the
men
who
already
hold
the
land
by
right
.
"
"
You
will
break
up
Broadwood
and
sell
it
to
"
I
will
.
"
your
farmers
?
"
Lord
Somers
was
seriously
affected
by
this
extraordinary
announcement
;
but
he
knew
Hamerton
too
well
to
remonstrate
or
argue
.
Mr.
Wyville
,
looking
across
his
paper
,
observed
both
speakers
,
and
listened
to
the
conversation
,
evidently
pleased
.
