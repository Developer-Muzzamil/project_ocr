"
Then
why
not
give
him
the
package
?
"
"
Because
he
is
a
bushman
,
and
might
be
wronged
.
With
two
influential
persons
,
support
his
title
,
there
would
be
no
question
raised
.
You

compel

Yes
,

said
Mr.
Wyville
,
smiling
,
"
and
also
of
Tapairu
.
This
property
will
descend
to
them
.
"
"
Are
they
with
the
chief
now
?
"
"
"
No
;
by
this
time
they
have
reached
Mr.
Sheridan's
happy
valley
,
where
it
is
probable
they
will
remain
.
You
see
,
it
is
possible
to
step
from
the
bush
into
civilization
;
but
it
is
not
quite
so
pleasant
to
step
back
into
the
bush
--
especially
for
girls
.
Ngarra

,
had
no
second
thought
on
the
subject
;
he
was
a
spearman
again
the
moment
he
landed
.
"
The
ride
to
Perth
was
pleasantly
passed
in
conversation
;
and
,
on
their
arrival
,
they
ordered
dinner
to
be
served
on
the
cool
verandah
.
While
waiting
there
,
a
rough
-
looking
,
man
approached
and
touched
his
hat
to
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Be
you
the
Comptroller
-
General
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Yes
.
"
"
"
Well
,
sir
,
here
,
you
see
my
ticket
,
and
here's
my
full
discharge
.
I
want
to
leave
the
colony
;
and
I
want
a
pass
to
King
George's
Sound
,
where
I.
I
can
find
a
ship
going
to
Melbourne
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
examined
the
papers
;
they
were
all
right
.
The
man
had
a
right
to
the
hotel
to
write

asked
the

in

"
No

said
Mr.
Wyville
,
looking
closely
at
him
,
"
but
if
I
give
you
a

,
you
do
not

"
"
Well

"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
rather
surprised
at
the
fellow's
pass
.
He
entered
the
hotel
and
as
the
hand
wrote
,
the
mind
turned
over
the
man's
words
,
dwelling
on
his
last
expression
,
that
he
would
rather
have
his
ticket
-
of
-
leave
than
take
a
pass
from
the
colony
yet
,
in
any
other
country
,
it
was
a
proof
of
shame
,
not
a
safeguard
.
The
man
did
not
look
stupid
,
though
his
words
were
so
.
As
Mr.
Wyville
finished
Writing
,
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
Ngarra
-
jil
watching
him
as
usual
.
He
raised
his
finger
slightly
--
Ngarra
-
jil
was
beside
him
.
A
few
words
in
the
native
tongue
,
spoken
in
a
low
tone
,
sent
Ngarra
-
jil
back
to
his
bench
,
where
he
sat
like
an
ebony
figure
till
he
saw
Mr.
Wyville-

to
the
verandah

He
then
rose
and
went
out

He

Mr.
Wyville
did
not
answer
,
but
he
took
hold
of
Hamerton's
arm
,
and
pointed
to
a
corner
of
the
street
where
at
the
moment
the
man
was
passing
under

lamp
,
walking
hurriedly

him
closely

Mr.

smiled
and
nodded

"
I
thought
it
just
as
well
to
know
where
the

night

he
said
.
"
A

minutes
later
,

What

asked
Hamerton
:
"
Nothing
,

'
"
But
he
is
a

man
.
"
Can

THE

was
the
afternoon
of
a
day
of
oppressive
heat
on
which
Mr.
Wyville
and
Hamerton
started
from
Perth
to

to

mountains

They
were
