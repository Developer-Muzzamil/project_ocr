Harriet
staggered
I
across
the
room
at
the
first
dreadful
thought
of
the
bitter
suffering
endured
by
another
for
her
crime
.
She
had
partially
repented
,
it
is
true
;
but
,
secretly
,
she
knew
that
she
had
never
pitied
her
rival
.
Now
,
she
could
have
suddenly
died
with
grief
for
her
wrong
.
Harriet
did
not
know
that
a
strong
hand
upheld
her
as
she
fell
,
and
supported
her
from
the
room
.
She
recovered
in
the
.
open
air
,
and
looked
about
her
as
if
awakening
from
a
terrible
dream
.
Sister
Cecilia
came
and
led
her
back
to
her
old
solitary
quarters
in
the
hospital
.
Mr.
Wyville
and
the
doctor
stood
beside
Draper's
bed
.
He
had
swooned
.
"
Is
he
dead
?
"
"
No
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
he
has
come
out
of
the
fever
quite
strong
.
He
will
recover
,
unless
something
unforeseen
interfere
.
He
is
out
of
danger
.
"
THE
DARKNESS
OF
DESOLATION
THE
recovery
of
Captain
Draper
was
regarded
of
confidence
to
them
the
fever
daily
declined
.
as
a
good
amen
by
the
sailors
and
convicts
;
and
with
a
return
The
average
of
recoveries
grew
larger
,
and
there
were
few
new
seizures
.
From
the
day
of
his
interview
with
Harriet
,
Draper
saw
her
no
more
.
Neither
did
he
see
Mr.
Wyville
.
The
steward
alone
attended
him
.
He
was
forced
to
ponder
on
the
future
,
and
every
new
possibility
was
harder
to
accept
than
the
last
.
During
those
days
of
convalescence
,
his
coward
soul
preyed
upon
by
his
villainous
imagination
,
Draper
suffered
almost
the
torments
of
the
damned
.
When
the
heartbroken
Harriet
recovered
from
the
excitement
of
the
dreadful
interview
,
her
soul
had
only
feeling-
-remorse
.
As
one
dying
of
thirst
might
sit
down
on
the
burning
sand
,
and
commune
with
the
room
,
and
communed
for
devouring
fire
in
the
body
.
so
this
unhappy
one
sat
upon
her
pallet
in
the
hospital
re
hours
with
the
newly
-
lighted
consuming
fire
in
her
soul
.
one
At
last
Mr.
Wyville
entered
the
hospital
,
with
the
physician
.
He
approached
Harriet
,
and
spoke
in
a
low
tone
,
such
as
he
had
used
when
addressing
her
once
before
.
"
Do
you
remember
me
?
"
She
looked
at
him
in
surprise
,
at
first
;
but
,
;
as
she
continued
to
gaze
,
there
rose
in
her
mind
a
recollection
that
brought
the
blood
strongly
from
her
heart
.
She
clasped
her
hands
beseechingly
.
"
I
thought
I
had
dreamt
it
in
the
cell-
-I
did
not
know
that
it
was
real
.
Oh
,
sir
,
did
you
not
come
to
me
and
speak
blessed
words
of
comfort
?
Did
you
not
say
that
he
was
guilty
of
part
of
my
crime
?
"
"
Yes
;
it
was
I
who
visited
you
in

I

now
to
:

one
who
has
borne
your
penalty

the

words

"
Thank
Heaven
,
it
is
not
too
late
!
This
moment
let
me
do
what
is
to
be
done
.
Oh
,
Sir
,
I
know
now
the
whole
of

saw
it
till
this
day
.
I
never
pitied
her
nor
thought
of
her
;
but
now
,
when
I
could
ask
for
even
God's
pardon
,
I
dare
not
ask
for
hers
.
"
my
crime--
Seeing
Harriet
in
this
repentant
mind
,
Mr.
Wyville
lost
no
time
in
having
her
confession
formally
taken
down
and
witnessed
.
This
done
,
he
spoke
comforting
words
to
Harriet
,
who
,
indeed
,
was
relieved
by
the
confession
,
and
felt
happier
than
she
had
been
for
years
.
Assembling
the
officers
of
the
convict
service
in
the
cabin
,
immediately
afterwards
,
Mr.
Wyville
took
his
first
step
as
Comptroller
-
General
,
by
announcing
that
Alice
Walmsley
was
no
longer
a
prisoner
,
that
her
innocence
had
been
fully
established
by
the
confession
of
the
real
criminal
,
and
that
henceforth
she
was
to
be
treated
respectfully
.
When
this
news
was
given
to
Sister
Cecilia
,
she
almost
lost
her
placid
self
-
control
in
an
outburst
of
happiness
.
But
she
controlled
herself
,
and
only
wept
for
very
gladness
.
Then
she
started
up
,
and
almost
ran
towards
her
secluded
room
,
to
break
the
tidings
to
Alice
.
as
a
passenger
.
Alice
was
sewing
when
Sister
Cecilia
entered
.
She
had
acquired
a
habit
of
sewing
during
her
long
solitary
confinement
,
and
now
she
was
happiest

.
The
kind
little
nun
almost
regretted
that
she
bore
news
that
would
break
the
calm
stream
of
Alice's
life
.
She
was
happy
as
she
was
,
would
she
be
happier
under
better
circumstances
?
Would
the
awakened
memories
counterbalance
or
sink
the
benefit
?
"
Good
news
,
Alice
!
"
Alice
looked
up
from
her
sewing
inquiringly
.
"
Is
the
fever
over
at
last
?
"
she
asked
.
"
Better
than
that
,
my
child
,
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
,
sitting
clown
beside
her
,
and
putting
an
arm
around
her
with
tender
affection
.
