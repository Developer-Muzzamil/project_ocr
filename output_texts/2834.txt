Mr.
Wyville's
face
might
have

words
of
Haggett
.
absolutely
unconscious
did
he
seem
of
the
presence
or
prison
.
He
stood
The
tumbrils
rolled
from
the
yard
with
their
strange
freight
,
and
Mr.
Haggett
strode
from
the
on
the
poop
of
the
transport
as
she
sailed
from
Portland
that
afternoon
.
More
than
once
that
day
did
Haggett's
words
repeat
themselves
like
a
threat
in
Mr.
Wyville's
mind
;
and
when
all
was
silent
in
sleeping
London
that
night
,
he
arose
from
the
study
table
at
which
he
wrote
,
and
paced
the
room
in
sombre
thought
.
His
mind
was
reasoning
with
itself
and
at
last
the
happier
side
conquered
.
He
stopped
his
tireless
walk
,
and
smiled
;
but
it
was
a
sad
smile
.
"
Poor
children
!
"
he
murmured
;
"
what
would
become
of
them
here
?
I
must
instruct
Tapairu
,
and
-
-
and
then
,
"
he
said
,
looking
reverently
upward
through
the
night
,
"
Thy
will
be
done

AFTER
NINE
YEARS
.
So
the
state
of
Alice
Walmsley
was
not
changed
by
the
zeal
of
Mr.
Haggett
,
indeed
,
no
change
had
resulted
from
it
except
the
increased
hatred
of
the
Chief
Director
for
Mr.
Wyville
,
and
the
sleuth
-
dog
errand
on
which
Haggett
had
sailed
for
Australia
Alice
did
not
know
nor
think
of
the
causes
that
had
kept
her
from
transportation
.
One
day
she
was
quietly
informed
by
the
warder
that
the
ship
had
sailed
.
She
hardly
knew
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
,
for
her
own
sake
;
but
of
late
she
had
not
been
quite
alone
in
the
world
.
Her
eyes
filled
with
tears
,
and
she
clasped
her
hands
before
her
"
You
are
sorry
,
Number
Four
,
"
said
the
warder
.
"
She
was
so
good
--
she
made
me
so
happy
,
"
answered
Alice
,
with
streaming
eyes
.
"
Who
?
"
"
Sister
Cecilia
.
"
"
She
has
not
gone
,
"
said
the
warder
,
smiling
;
"
see
,
she
is
coming
here
.
Good
day
,
Sister
;
somebody
was
crying
for
you
.
"
The
joy
of
Alice
was
unbounded
,
as
she
held
the
serge
dress
of
Sister
Cecilia
,
and
looked
in
her
kind
and
pleasant
face
.
The
change
in
Alice's
character
was
more
marked
in
this
scene
than
in
any
circumstance
since
the
gleam
of
the
flower
had
caught
her
eye
in
the
cell
.
The
strong
will
seemed
to
have
departed
;
the
self-
reliance
,
born
of
wrong
and
anguish
,
had
disappeared
;
she
was
a
simple
and
impulsive
girl
again
.
Between
the
innocent
happiness
of
her
young
life
and
the
fresh
tenderness
now
springing
in
her
heart
,
there
awful
gulf
of
sorrow
and
despair
.
But
she
was
on
the
high
bank
--
she
looked
across
the
gloom
and
saw
&
fields
beyond
,
and
,
as
she
looked
,
the
far
shore
drew
nearer
to
her
,
and
the
dismal
strait
between
grew
narrower
.
lay

said
Sister
Cecilia
,
gravely
,
when
the

greeting
was
over

The
light
faded
from
Alice's
face
,
and
after
a
long
look
,
full
of
sadness
,
at
the
Sister
,
she
bent
her
face
into
her
hands
,
remaining
silent
.

I

-

do

ask

?
"
she
said
,
wistfully
.
"
Because
it
is
not
right
that
an
innocent
person
should
remain
here
.
Tell
me
the

child
,
and
let
me
see
what
can
be
done
.
"
"
O
,
Sister
Cecilia
,
I
cannot-
-I
cannot
!
"
sobbed
Alice
.
"
O
,
do
not
ask
me
-
-
do
not
make
me
think
of
my
sweet
little
baby-
-I
cannot
think
of
it
dead
-
-
indeed
,
I
cannot
speak
of
that
!
"
"
"
Alice
,
"
said
the
nun
,
"
your
baby
is
with
God
,
saved
from
the
stains
and
sorrows
of
life
.
This
woman
,
"
and
the
voice
of
Sister
Cecilia
grew
almost
severe
,
"
this
terrible
woman
--
I
have
heard
that
she
is
a
bad
and
wretched
woman
,
Alice
--
deserves
nothing
from
you
!
i
but
justice
.
God
demands
justice
to
ourselves
as
well
as
to
others
.
"
"
I
cannot
accuse
her
,
"
answered
Alice
,
in
a
low
voice
,
gradually
returning
to
its
old
firmness
.
"
She
has
suffered
I
more
than
I
-
-
God
pardon
her
!
And
I
know
that
she
suffered
first
.
"
"
Well
child
,
"
said
the
nun
,
deeply
affected
,
"
we
must
ask
for
a
pardon
,
then

for
you

Alice
arose
from
her
low
seat
,
and
stood
before
the
window
,
looking
upward
,
with
her
hands
clasped
before
her
--
an
attitude
grown
familiar
to
her
of
late

;
