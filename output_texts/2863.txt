He
had
risen
as
he
spoke
-
-Draper's
eyes
followed
his
face
.
The
strength
of
manhood
,
even
of
facial
deceit
,
having
been
drained
by
the
fever
,
there
was
nothing
left
of
Draper's
real
self
but
his
wily
nature
.
As
Mr.
Wyville
rose
,
the
door
opened
slowly
,
and
Harriet
entered
,
advanced
a
few
steps
,
and
stood
still
in
fear
.
She
looked
at
her
husband's
face
;
for
.
one
instant
his
cold
eye
from
Mr.
Wyville
and
took
her
in
,
then
returned
to
its
former
direction
.
Harriet's
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
.
A
cold
and
despairing
numbness
began
to
creep
over
her
.
She
foresaw
the
nature
of
the
meeting
--
she
knew
now
what
would
be
her
reception
.
Her
limbs
slowly
failed
her
,
and
she
sank
on
the
floor
,
not
heavily
,
but
hopelessly
and
dumb
.
Mr.
Wyville

the
slight
sound

With
a
rush
of
indignation
in
his
blood
,
almost
a
turned
,
and
read
the
story
of
despair
like
mounting
to
wrath
,
he
regarded
Draper
.
an
open
page
.
"
Remember
,
"
he
said
,
sternly
,
"
your
guilt
is
known
.
You
still
have
one
chance
to
escape
the
punishment
you
deserve
.
It
lies
in
her
hands
.
He
turned
from
the
bed
,
and
left
the
room
.
Draper
lay
motionless
for
several
minutes
,
knowing
that
his
victim
and
wife
was
gravelling
in
the
room
,
waiting
for
his
word
.
"
Come
here
,
"
he
said
at
length
,
in
a
voice
all
the
colder
for
its
weakness
.
Harriet
crept
to
the
bed
,
and
laid
her
head
near
his
hand
.
But
he
did
not

her
.
"

raised
her
miserable
face
until
their
eyes
met
.
Hers
were
streaming
with
bitter
tears
.
His
were
as
cold
and
dry
as
a
snake's
.
She
would
have
cried
out

name
but
the
freezing
glitter
of

eyes

"

and

said
slowly
,
as
if
thinking
aloud
,
"
And

at

?

hope
for
her
.
Poor
Harriet
sank
down
slowly
,
the
slow
shudder
creeping
over
her
once
more
..
Her
blood
had
ceased
to
course
in
her
veins
at
the
cruel
reception
.
She
had
no
thoughts
:
she
only
felt
there
was
no
!
The
first
love
of
some
women
is
mysteriously
tenacious
.
It
ceases
to
be
a
passion
,
and
becomes
a
principle
of
life
.
It
is
never
destroyed
until
life
e
ceases
.
It
may
change
into
a
torture
-
-
it
may
became
excited
like
a
white-
take
on
a
lesser
fire
,
and

into

but

,
burning
the
heart

or
it
may

--
it
never
loses
its
power
to
command
at
a
thrill
the
deepest
motives
of
her
nature
.
Through
all
phases
but
one
had
passed
the
love
of
Harriet
Draper
.
She
knew
that
her
husband
was
a
villain
,
that
her
hideous
degradation
had
come
from
his
hand
;
that
he
hated
her
now
and
would
be
rid
of
her
;
and
the
knowledge
had
only
changed
her
love
to
a
torture
without
killing
it
.
But
the
change
from
white
heat
to
fierce
red
is
not
infinite
.
It
is
a
transition
rapidly
made
.
At
the
white
heat
,
the
woman's
love
burns
herself
;
at
the
red
,
it
burns
the
man
she
loves
.
A
woman's
hatred
is
only
her
love
on
fire
.
"
I
didn't
think
it
was
you
,
"
said
Draper
,
making
no
pretence
to
deceive
her
;
"
I
thought
you
were
dead
years
ago
.
!!
Something
stirred
in
Harriet's
heart
at
the
emphasis
-
-something
like
a
grain
of
resentment
.
She
had
forgotten
self
;
she
now
thought
of
herself
,
and
of
what
she
had
gone
through
for
this
man's
sake
.
"
How
did
you
come
here
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Did
--
he
bring
you
here
?
Oh
,
curse
you
,
you've
got
me
in
the
trap
.
Well
,
we'll
see
.
"
--you
"
"
I
have
made
no
trap
,
"
said
Harriet
;
"
no
one
brought
me
here
but
myself
and--
I
am
a
prisoner
.
"
Draper
was
evidently
surprised
at
this
news
,
but
it
only
momentarily
checked
his
rancour
"
I
suppose
you
robbed
someone
,
or

?
"
As
he
spoke
,
Harriet
struggled
to
her
knees
with
a
pitiful
gulping
sound
,
and
clutched
at
the
bedclothes
,
trying
to
gain
her
feet
.
Draper
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
continued
slowly--
"
I
suppose
you
robbed
someone
,
or
murdered-
-
"
-
"
With
a
spring
like
a
tiger
,
and
a
terrible
low
on
her
feet
,
the
coverlet
in
her
clenched
hands
,
her
flaming
eyes
on
her
husband's
face
.
"
Dare
!
"
she
hissed
,
"
and
I
will
tear
the
tongue
from
your
cruel
mouth
!
"
Harriet
was
счу
For
half
a
minute
the
two
regarded
each
other
.
In
that
half
minute
,
the
white
heat
of
Harriet's
love
became
red
.
Hitherto
,
she
had
hated
the
one
.
for
whom
Draper
had
deserted
her
,
and
had
hated
herself
.
Now
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
hated
him
.
"
Villain
!
monster
!
"
she
cried
,
throwing
the
coverlet
from
her
with
fierce
revulsion
;
"
you
speak
of
murder
to
the
murderess
you
made
?
Oh
,
God
,
God
!
is
there
no
lightning
to
strike
this
man
dead
!
Murder
I
have
done
in
madness
"
--she
paused
with
upraised
hands
,
as
if
she
saw
a
vision-
-
"
Oh
,
merciful
God
!
that
innocent
one
!
"
