of
those
specially
confided
to
his
care
.
He
was
shocked
to
the
centre
five
years
,
he
now
deemed
her
one
when
first
he
saw
the
white
-
capped
nun
sitting
in
the
cell
,
with
a
rosary
in
her
hands
Mr.
Haggett
would
have
complained
at
once
,
but
he
did
not
like
the
governor
.
He
had
been
insulted
--
he
felt
he
had
--
by
the
governor
,
who
never
met
him
but
be
asked
the
same
impertinent
question
:
"
Well
,
Mr.
Haggett
,
got
your
regular
commission
in
the
ministry
yet
?
"
Mr.
Haggett
was
in
hopes
of
becomings
.
some
day
,
a
regular
minister
of
the
Established
Church
.
He
was
"
studying
for
it
,
"
he
said
;
and
his
long
experience
in
the
prison
would
tell
in
his
favour
.
But
the
years
!
flown
,
and
he
had
not
secured
the
reverend
title
he
so
ardently
coveted
.
The
Lords
Bishops
were
not
favourably
impressed
by
Mr.
Haggett's
acquirements
or
qualities
.
The
daily
presence
of
the
nun
in
one
of
his
cells
goaded
him
to
desperation
.
He
stopped
one
had
day
at
the
door
of
Number
Four
,
and
,
in
his
deepest
chest
-
tones
,
with
a
smile
that
drew
heavily
on
the
labial
reefs
,
addressed
the
Sister-
"
Is
this
prisoner
a
Rom
--
ah
--
one
of
your
persuasion
,
madam
?
'
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
the
little
Sister
,
with
a
kind
smile
at
Alice
;
"
I
wish
she
were
.
"
"
"
Hah
!
-
-
Why
,
madam
,
do
you
visit
a
prisoner
who
is
not
of
your
persuasion
?
"
"
Because
no
one
else
visited
her
,
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
,
looking
at
Mr.
Haggett
with
rather
a
startled
air
,
"
and
she
needed
someone
.
"
"
Madam
,
I
wish
to
pray
with
this
prisoner
this
morning
,
and
ah
-
ah
-
I
will
thank
you
to
leave
this
cell
.
"
The
work
dropped
from
Alice's
hands
,
and
a
wild
look
came
into
her
eyes
.
First
,
she
stared
at
Mr.
Haggett
,
if
she
did
not
understand
.
From
his
uninviting
face
,
now
flushed
somewhat
,
and
working
as
if
the
godly
.
were
in
a
passion
,
she
turned
,
with
a
mute
appeal
,
to
Sister
Cecilia
The
nun
had
risen
,
startled
,
but
not
confused
,
at
the
unexpected
harshness
of
the
tone
,
rather
than
the
words
.
She
realized
at
once
that
Mr.
Haggett
,
who
had
never
before
addressed
her
,
nor
noticed
her
had
power
to
expel
her
from
Alice's
cell
,
and
forbid
her
entrance
in
future
.
She
determined
on
the
moment
to
make
an
effort
for
Alice's
sake
.
man
presence
,
"
This
prisoner
is
to
be
my
hospital
assistant
on
the
convict
ship
,
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
to
Mr.
Haggett
.
as
"
Madam
!
"
said
Mr.
Haggett
,
harshly
,
and
there
was
a
movement
of
his
foot
as
if
he
would
have
stamped
his
order
,
"
I
wish
to
pray
with
this
prisoner
!
"
He
motioned
commandingly
with
his
hand
,
ordering
the
nun
from
the
cell
.
Sister
Cecilia
took
a
step
towards
the
door
,
rather
alarmed
at
the
man's
violence
,
but
filled
with
keen
sorrow
for
poor
Alice
.
The
rude
finger
of
the
angry
Scripture
.
-reader
still
pointed
from
the
cell
.
Sister
Cecilia
had
taken
one
step
outward
,
when
Alice
Walmsley
darted
past
her
,
and
stood
facing
Mr.
Haggett
,
her
left
hand
reached
behind
her
with
spread
fingers
,
as
if
forbidding
the
nun
,
to
depart
.
།།
"
Begone
!
"
she
cried
to
"
Haggett
,
"
How
dare
come
here
?
I
do
not
want
your
prayers
.
"
you
Mr.
Haggett
grew
livid
with
passion
at
this
insult
from
a
prisoner
.
He
had
,
perhaps
,
cherished
a
secret
dislike
of
Alice
for
her
old
rebellion
against
his
influence
.
He
glared
at
her
a
moment
in
silent
fury
,
while
his
great
lips
curved
into
their
tightest
reefs
,
showing
the
full
line
of
his
long
teeth
.
But
he
did
not
answer
her
.
He
looked
over
her
,
into
the
cell
,
where
Sister
Cecilia
stood
affrighted
.
He
reached
his
long
y
arm
towards
her
,
and
still
commanded
her
from
the
cell
,
with
a
hand
trembling
with
wrath
.
He
would
settle
with
the
recalcitrant
convict
when
this
strange
ally
and
witness
had
departed
.
"
Come
out
!
"
motioned
the
lips
of
the
wrathful
Scripture
reader
,
while
his
long
finger
crooked
,
as
if
it
were
a
hook
to
draw
her
forth
.
At
this
moment
,
a
key
rattled
in
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
,
and
there
entered
the
passage
Sir
Joshua
Habb
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
and
the
governor
,
followed
by
the
two
warders
of
the
pentagon
.
The
gentlemen
were
evidently
y
on
a
tour
of
inspection
.
When
they
had
come
to
the
cell
of
Number
Four
,
they
stood
in
astonishment
at
the
scene
.
Alice
Walmsley
,
hitherto
so
submissive
and
silent
,
was
aroused
into
feverish
excitement
.
She
stood
facing
Mr.
Haggett
,
and
,
as
the
others
approached
,
she
turned
to
them
wildly
.
"
How
dare
this
man
interfere
with
me
?
"
she
cried
.
"
I
will
not
allow
him
to
come
near
me
.
I
will
not
have
his
I__
"
prayers
.
"
Be
calm
,
child
!
"
'
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
whom
she
had
never
before
seen
.
His
impressive
and
kind
face
and
tone
instantly
affected
the
prisoner
.
Her
hands
fell
to
her
sides
.
"
Lock
that
cell
.
"
said
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
,
in
a
hard
,
quick
voice
.
"
This
prisoner
must
be
brought
to
her
senses
.
"
Alice
was
again
defiant
in
an
instant
.
