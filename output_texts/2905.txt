for
a
neighbour
.
I've
often
thought
it
a
shame
that
so
fine
a
place
.
as
this
should
have
no
other
master
than
a
lawyer
begging
Mr.
Woodruff's
pardon
and
I
,
am
glad
to
see
one
of
the
old
name
here
.
again
.
I
'
'
ve
taken
the
liberty
of
calling
so
early
to
be
the
first
to
say
so
,
and
to
see
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
.
"
Quite
out
of
breath
after
the
longest
speech
he
had
ever
made
in
his
life
,
and
astonished
at
his
own
eloquence
,
Sir
Miles
ceased
and
took
his
seat
.
Mr.
Mornington
replied
courteously
,
but
in
few
words
,
and
adroitly
brought
the
conversation
from
the
past
to
the
present
;
while
Sir
Miles
,
thanking
heaven
that
the
ordeal
was
over
,
presented
his
son
,
who
acknowledged
Mr.
Mornington's
salutation
in
a
sheepish
way
,
and
became
again
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
his
boots
.
From
this
inspection
he
was
aroused
only
by
the
entrance
of
Eva
.
She
had
known
the
Averills
all
her
life
,
and
during
.
one
of
her
brief
visits
to
Mornington
had
stopped
with
nor
son
were
prepared
to
find
her
them
,
but
she
had
seen
none
of
them
for
several
and
neither
father
years
,
become
so
beautiful
.
Sir
Miles
ventured
upon
a
few
homely
but
well
-
meant
compliments
,
which
Eva
laughingly
accepted
with
a
good
grace
.
The
effect
of
her
entrance
on
the
younger
Averill
was
such
as
to
divert
his
à
gaze
from
his
boots
to
Eva's
face
,
from
which
he
never
once
removed
it
during
the
rest
of
their
stay
staring
with
such
astonishment
and
open
-
mouthed
admiration
,
that
Eva
was
fain
to
give
vent
to
her
laughter
by
pretending
it
was
for
Sir
Miles
'
frequent
but
pointless
jokes
.
When
they
prose
to
go
the
youth
became
so
painfully
embarrassed
between
his
desire
to
address
Eva
and
his
fear
of
ridicule
(
for
,
like
all
shy
people
,
he
was
fully
conscious
of
his
defect
)
that
the
lady
took
pity
on
him
.
Walking
down
the
hall
,
and
repressing
her
strong
inclination
to
laugh
,
she
spoke
to
him
.
"
I
like
your
horse
.
"
"
Do
you
?
Now
,
"
When
have
"
you
i
must
be
a
judge
.
You
ride
beautifully
.
"
you
seen
me
?
"
"
You
passed
us
yesterday
.
"
He
was
nearly
adding
that
it
was
owing
to
seeing
her
that
he
had
called
with
his
father
.
"
You
are
fond
of
riding
.
I
suppose
?
"
said
Eva
.
"
Very
,
"
was
the
reply
;
"
at
least
,
sometimes
.
I
should
like
it
better
if
—
I
mean
I
don't
like
it
so
much
riding
alone
.
"
"
You
prefer
riding
with
your
father
?
"
said
Eva
,
rather
puzzled
.
"
Well
,
no
,
yes
,
"
"
;
that
is
,
I
like
riding
with
a
companion
—
a
lady
.
"
"
Any
lady
?
I
see
.
I
have
heard
of
a
preference
for
riding
mistresses
;
it
forms
a
horseman
better
.
"
;
no
;
I
say
I
should
find
the
greatest
pleasure
in
it
if
my
companion
were
you
.
"
"
"
No₂
"
Pretty
well
!
You
do
not
use
the
curb
hand
,
the
while
he
reddened
deeply
.
an
your
tongue
,
I
see
!
"
but
she
was
not
vexed
,
and
let
him
press
her
He
and
his
father
were
,
however
,
hardly
,
more
than
out
of
earshot
before
Eva
,
unable
any
longer
to
conceal
her
amusement
,
burst
into
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
,
in
which
she
was
joined
,
to
a
more
moderate
degree
,
by
Mr.
Mornington
,
who
had
been
a
witness
of
the
little
episode
.
The
laugh
was
still
echoing
when
Godfrey
arrived
with
a
proposition
that
they
should
elude
another
avalanche
of
congratulators
by
spending
an
hour
at
the
covers
.
His
father
placidly
assented
,
and
bidding
good
-
bye
to
Mr.
Woodruff
,
who
was
leaving
by
the
afternoon
train
,
father
and
son
strolled
down
to
the
keeper's
lodge
.
Mr.
Cameron
,
who
joined
them
there
,
was
a
good
shot
,
and
Godfrey
still
a
better
;
but
both
were
eclipsed
by
Mr.
Mornington
,
who
never
missed
a
bird
with
either
barrel
,
and
whose
performance
was
a
of
amazement
to
the
keepers
,
as
well
as
to
Godfrey
and
Mr.
Cameron
.
His
school
of
musketry
had
been
that
in
the
wild
region
where
Bruin
and
hostile
Indians
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
costliness
of
ammunition
,
forced
a
marksman
to
shoot
but
once
,
and
that
with
no
miss
,
lest
the
.
were
source
enemy
upon
him
.
The
sport
was
capital
,
the
birds
,
if
wild
,
being
plentiful
,
and
they
became
so
interested
that
,
at
Mr.
Cameron's
suggestion
,
they
had
a
slight
lunch
at
his
cottage
,
and
stayed
out
during
the
whole
afternoon
,
only
returning
home
when
it
was
getting
dark
.
Mr.
Mornington
declared
that
he
had
seldom
spent
so
pleasant
a
day
,
and
Godfrey
was
almost
inclined
to
echo
his
opinion
.
The
next
day
being
Sunday
,
all
Mornington
was
early
at
church
to
catch
a
glimpse
at
the
new
squire
.
Even
the
pale
,
tremulous
curate
was
more
nervous
than
usual
,
and
had
taken
special
pains
with
his
sermon
,
which
,
as
a
sort
of
compliment
to
the
great
man
,
was
from
Job
,
the
Man
of
Tribulation
.
But
the
congregation
had
hurried
and
the
curate
exerted
himself
in
vain
,
for
Eva
and
Mrs.
Neville
were
the
sole
occupants
of
the
squire's
pen
.
Eva
had
expected
her
father
would
accompany
them
,
but
,
on
her
suggesting
it
,
he
had
,
to
her
great
disappointment
,
politely
but
firmly
declined
,
and
,
to
her
increased
distress
,
the
few
words
in
which
he
had
excused
himself
,
seemed
indicative
of
a
resolve
never
to
do
so
.
Godfrey
I
was
out
of
the
question
,
as
he
was
no
churchgoer
.
Indeed
,
he
was
seldom
down
before
half
-
past
eleven
,
unless
there
was
