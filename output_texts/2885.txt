primitive
life
of
the
bush
.
For
weeks
before
,
the
air
had
been
filled
with
an
irritating
smoke
,
that
clung
to
the
earth
all
day
,
and
was
blown
far
inland
by
the
sea
-
1
-breeze
at
night
.
As
the
horsemen
were
leaving
Perth
,
they
met
a
travel
-
stained
police
trooper
,
carrying
the
mail
from
the
southern
districts
.
He
recognized
the
Comptroller
General
,
and
saluted
respectfully
as
he
passed
.
"
Where
is
the
fire
,
trooper
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
In
the
Bunbury
district
,
sir
,
and
moving
towards
the
Vasse
Road
.
It
has
burnt
on
the
plains
inside
the
sea-
hills
for
three
weeks
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
will
reach
the
heavy
bush
on
the
uplands
.
"
They
rode
at
a
steady
and
rapid
pace
,
conversing
little
,
like
men
bent
on
a
long
and
tedious
journey
.
·
The
evening
closed
on
them
when
they
were
crossing
the
Darling
Range
.
From
the
desolate
mountain
-
road
,
as
they
descended
,
they
saw
the
sun
standing
large
and
red
,
on
the
horizon
.
Before
them
,
at
the
foot
of
the
range
,
stretched
a
waste
of
white
sand
,
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
over
which
their
road
lay
.
The
setting
of
the
sun
on
such
a
scene
has
an
awfulness
hard
to
be
described
.
The
whiteness
of
the
sand
seems
to
increase
until
it
becomes
ghastly
,
while
every
low
ridge
casts
a
black
shadow
.
During
this
time
of
twilight
the
sand
-
plain
has
a
weirdly
sombre
aspect
.
When
the
night
.
comes
in
its
black
shroud
or
silvery
moonlight
,
the
supernatural
effect
is
dispelled
.
As
the
travellers
rade
down
towards
the
plain
,
impressed
by
this
ghostly
hour
,
Mr.
Wyville
called
Hamerton's
attention
to
two
dark
objects
moving
.
the
sand
at
a
distance
.
an
Hamerton
unslung
his
field
-
glass
,
and
looked
at
the
objects
.
"
"
A
man
and
a
woman
,
"
he
said
,
"
they
are
going
ahead
,
and
the
woman
carries
a
load
like
the
natives
.
"
Soon
after
,
the
sun
went
down
beyond
the
desert
,
and
the
plain
was
dark
.
The
horsemen
spurred
on
,
oppressed
by
the
level
monotony
before
them
.
They
had
forgotten
the
travellers
who
were
crossing
,
the
Weary
waste
on
foot
.
Suddenly
Hamerton's
horse
swerved
,
and
a
voice
in
the
darkness
ahead
shouted
something
.
It
was
a
command
from
the
man
on
.
foot
,
addressed
to
the
woman
,
who
,
in
her
weariness
and
with
her
burden
,
had
not
been
able
to
keep
pace
with
him
,
and
had
fallen
behind
.
"
Come
alongs
4
curse
you
!
or
I'll
be
all
night
on
this
plain
.
"
The
speaker
had
not
seen
nor
heard
the
horsemen
,
whose
advance
was
hidden
by
the
night
and
the
soft
sand
.
They
rode
close
behind
the
woman
,
and
heard
her
laboured
breathing
as
she
increased
her
speed
.
A
sense
e
of
acute
sorrow
struck
at
once
the
hearts
of
the
riders
.
They
had
recognized
the
voice
as
that
of
Draper
--
they
knew
that
the
miserable
being
who
followed
him
and
received
his
curses
was
his
wife
.
They
rode
silently
behind
her
,
and
halted
noiselessly
as
she
came
up
with
her
husband
.
He
growled
at
her
as
she
approached
.
again
"
I
am
very
tired
,
Samuel
,
"
they
heard
her
say
in
a
low
,
uncomplaining
voice
;
"
and
I
fear
I'm
not
as
thought
I
was
.
'
She
stood
a
moment
as
she
spoke
,
as
if
relieved
by
the
moment's
breathing
-
space
.
strong
as
I
"
Look
here
,
"
he
said
in
a
hard
voice
,
meant
to
convey
the
brutal
threat
to
her
soul
,
"
if
you
can't
keep
up
,
you
na
mare
can
stay
behind
.
I'll
stop
,
e
for
you
;
so
you
can

"
O
,
Samuel
,
you

Do
you

?
"

wouldn't

me
in
this
terrible
place

!
Have

on
me
,
and
speak
kindly
to
me
,
and
I
will
keep
up

indeed
,
I'll
not

"
Have

on
you
?
"
he
hissed
between
his
teeth
,
"

brought
me
to
this
,
and

He
turned
and
strade
on
in
the
dark
.
She
had
heard
,
but
made
no
reply
.
She
struggled
forward
,
though
her
steps
even
now
were
unsteady
.
Mr.
Wyville
,
having
first
attracted
her
attention
by
a
slight
sound
,
so
that
she
should
not
be
frightened
,
rode
up
to
her
,
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
.
at
Pinjarra
.
"
"

General-
-

Give
me

You
will
find
it
when
you
arrive
at

inn
and
recognized
Mr.
Wyville
;
and
without
a
word
she
slipped
her
arms

from

straps
of

she
whispered
tremulously

She
looked

load
,
and
let
him
lift
it
from
her
.
"
Here
,
"
said
Hamerton
,
handing
her
his
wine
-
flask
,
keep
this
for
yourself
,
and
use
it
if
you
feel
your
strength
failing
.
"
"
Where
is
your

husband
going
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
He
is
going
to
the
Vasse
,
sir
.
A
whale
ship
has
come
in
there
,
and
he
thinks
she
will
take
us
off
.
"
They
rode
on
,
and
soon
overtook
Draper
.
Mr.
Wyville
addressed
him
in
a
stern
voice
.
