Again
he
thought
a
moment
,
before
his
reply
.
came
.
"
There
was
a
lake
,
from
which
two
streams
flowed
to
the
sea
.
One
river
wound
itself
around
the
feet
of
the
as
it
ran
,
and
smiling
back
at
the
sun
.
Its
flood
was
filled
with
course
,
but
Watering
the
fields
hills
,
taking
a
long
darting
fish
,
and
its
banks
fringed
with
rich
g
and
bright
flowers
.
The
other
stream
ran
into
a
grass
a
great
earthen
pipe
,
and
rolled
along
in
the
dark
.
It
reached
the
sea
first
,
but
it
had
no
fish
in
its
water
,
except
blind
ones
,
and
no
a
flowers
on
its
banks
.
This
stream
had
run
so
long
in
the
tunnel
without
its
own
will
that
it
preferred
this
way
to
the
winding
course
of
its
natural
bed
,
and
at
last
it
boasted
of
its
reverence
for
the
earthen
pipe
that
held
it
"
way
.
"
together
and
guided
its
blind
"
The
earthen
pipe
is
Lan
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr.
Little
,
"
that
men
come
in
time
to
love
.
'
Mr.
Wyville
,
who
had
smiled
at
the
ladies
all
through
his
allegory
,
did
not
answer
.
"
But
do
you
apply
the
allegory
to
all
law
?
"
asked
a
gentleman
of
the
staff
.
"
To
all
law
not
founded
on
God's
abstract
justice
,
which
provides
for
man's
right
to
the
planet
.
Sooner
or
later
,
human
laws
,
from
the
least
act
to
the
greatest
,
shall
be
brought
into
harmony
with
this
.
"
you
have
pushed
out
?
What
shall
we
have
instead
?
"
in
our
"
Will
you
give
us
substitutes
for
those
,
poor
virtues
that
"
Mankind
and
Liberty
--
instead
of
Patriotism
and
Law
.
Surely
,
the
exchange
is
generously
favour
.
"
Then
followed
a
general
discussion
,
in
which
everyone
had
a
hasty
word
.
Mr.
Wyville
said
no
more
;
but
drew
off
the
Governor
and
Hamerton
to
his
cabin
to
settle
some
geographical
inaccuracy
in
a
chart
of
the
coast
.
So
the
hours
passed
on
the
steamer
,
as
she
slowly
rounded
headlands
and
cut
across
bays
.
The
air
was
laden
with
the
breath
of
the
interminable
forest
.
On
shore
,
when
the
great
fires
swept
over
miles
of
sandalwood
and
jamwood
bush
,
the
heavy
perfume
from
the
burning
timber
lingered
on
the
calm
air
,
and
extended
far
over
land
and
sea
.
On
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
,
they
saw
before
them
the
mountains
of
the
Vasse
,
running
sheer
down
to
the
sea
,
in
two
parallel
ridges
about
six
miles
apart
.
The
land
between
these
high
ridges
was
cut
off
..
same
four
or
five
miles
back
,
by
a
line
,
of
mountain
which
joined
the
ridges
,
thus
forming
the
valley
which
Mr.
Sheridan
had
bought
from
Mr.
Wyville
.
As
the
steamer
drew
close
to
the
land
,
the
valley
assumed
the
perfect
shape
of
a
horse
-
shoe
.
From
the
sea
,
at
a
distance
,
it
seemed
a
retreat
of
delicious
coolness
and
verdure
.
The
mountains
were
wooded
high
up
their
sides
,
and
the
tops
were
so
steep
they
seemed
to
overhang
the
valley
.
Two
broad
and
bright
shallow
streams
,
which
tumbled
from
the
hills
at
the
head
of
the
valley
,
wound
through
the
rich
plain
,
and
calmly
merged
in
the
ocean
.
Exclamations
of
wonder
and
delight
were
on
every
lip
as
the
surpassing
beauties
of
the
scene
came
one
another
into
view
.
after
The
end
of
the
ridge
on
the
southern
side
ran
far
into
the
sea
;
and
here
,
under
Mr.
Wyville's
directions
,
years
before
,
a
strong
mahogany
pier
had
been
erected
,
which
made
a
safe
landing
-
place
for
even
great
ships
.
A
railed
platform
ran
round
the
foot
of
the
hills
,
and
brought
the
passengers
to
a
road
shaded
by
majestic
trees
that
swept
towards
the
farther
end
of
the
valley
.
Awaiting
their
arrival
were
easy
,
open
carriages
,
evidently
of
European
build
,
in
which
the
astonished
party
seated
themselves
.
The
drivers
were
some
black
,
4
some
white
,
but
they
were
all
at
home
in
their
places
.
The
scene
was
like
a
field
from
fairy
-
land
.
No
eye
accustomed
only
to
northern
vegetation
and
climate
,
can
conceive
unaided
the
glory
of
a
well
-
watered
Australian
vale
.
The
carriages
rolled
under
trees
of
splendid
fern
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
in
height
;
the
earth
was
variegated
with
rich
colour
in
flower
and
herbage
;
spreading
palms
of
every
variety
filled
the
eye
with
beauty
of
form
,
the
green
and
crimson
and
yellow
parrots
and
paroquets
rose
in
flocks
as
the
carriages
passed
;
and
,
high
over
all
the
beauteous
life
of
the
underwood
,
rose
the
grand
mahogany
and
tuad
and
gum
trees
of
the
forest
.
They
passed
cottages
bowered
in
flowers
,
and
ringed
by
tall
hedgerow's
composed
wholly
of
gorgeous
geraniums
.
The
strangers
who
looked
on
these
changing
revelations
of
loveliness
sat
silent
,
and
almost
tearful
.
Even
those
long
accustomed
to
Australian
scenery
were
amazed
at
the
beauty
of
the
valley
.
Mr.
Wyville
and
Mr.
Sheridan
had
ridden
rapidly
on
before
the
others
,
and
stood
uncovered
and
host
-
like
on
the
verandah
of
the
house
where
the
drive
ended
.
Alice
Walmsley
sat
in
the
foremost
carriage
,
and
was
the
first
to
alight
,
with
Sheridan's
hand
holding
hers
.
Their
eyes
.
met
as
she
stepped
to
his
side
.
His
lips
formed
.
one
short
word
,
of
which
only
her
e
conscious
-
-
eye
and
ear
were
"
Home
!
"
Exclamations
of
wonder
came
from
all
the
party
at
the
peerless
beauty
of
their
surroundings
.
The
house
was
wholly
built
of
bright
red
mahogany
beams
,
perfectly
fitted
,
with
rich
wood
-
carving
of
sandalwood
and
