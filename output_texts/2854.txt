the
yellow
flame
licked

with

rapidity

At
sight
of
the
flame
,
a
cry
of
alarm

rose
from
the
huddled
convicts
,
drowning
the
reports
of

were

It
was

of

The
bullet
destroyed
the
lock
,
but
did
not
force
it
.
At
that
moment
,
with
a
cry
of
success
,
an
officer
dashed
through
the
crowd
,
and
seized
the
lock
.
He
had
found
the
key
!
But
it
would
not
turn
in

shattered
wards

The

this
time
the
flames
had
spread
over

pile

had

The
pitch
bubbled
between

seams

deck

and
dense
volumes

smoke
poured
through

bars

The

from

The
officers
dashed
wildly
to
and
fro
.
Some
of
the
ship's
crew
had
begun
to
work
with
axes
on
the
roof
of
the
cage
,
which
was
a
heavily
-
timbered
deck
.
The
fire
began
to
roar
with
the
dreadful
sound
that
denotes
the
untamable
power
of
approaching
conflagration
.
At
this
moment
Mr.
Wyville
.
came
e
forward
,
and
with
one
glance
took
in
the
whole
scene
.
Everyone
made
way
for
him
as
he
strode
to
the
cage
.
The
convicts
prayed
him
,
"
save
us
!
"

ultimate
appeal

terror

stricken

.
He
stood
an
instant
looking
at
the
fire
--
saw
the
mortal
danger
.
In

"
No
!
"
shouted
Wyville
,
with
such
sudden
force
,
that
the
man
staggered
back
in
dismay
.
Mr.
Wyville
looked
at
the
lock
,
and
saw
its
condition
.
He
shook
the
bars
with
amazing
force
.
A
gust
of
flame
and
smoke
now
rushed
through
the
bars
and
drove
everyone
back
,
even
Mr.
Wyville
.
He
rushed
forward
again
;
then
turned
to
the
officers
,
who
had
retreated
to
the
foremast
,
and
called
them
to
him
.
No
one
moved
--
they
were
cowed
.
Another
instant
,
and
a
tall
man
pushed
through
the
crowd
,
and
stood
beside
Wyville
.
It
was
Mr.
Haggett
.
Their
eyes
met
for
one
instant
.
They
understood
one
another
.
"
What
do
you
want
?
"
asked
Haggett
,
in
a
low
,
steady
voice
.
"

silk
curtains
from

answered
Mr.
Wyville
in
the
same
tone

Next
moment
Haggett
was
clearing
a
lane
for
himself
through
and
over
the
crowd
.
He
disappeared
towards
the
cabin
.
They
knew
he
would
return
,
and
they
kept
the
way
open
for
him
.
In
half
a
minute
he
flew
back
,
in
each
hand
a
long
red
silken
curtain
,
torn
from
the
cabin
windows
.
after
the
other
.
Mr.
Wyville
stood
waiting
for
him
,
holding
in
his
hand
a
heavy
iron
belaying
pin
,
which
he
had
taken
from
the
rail
.
He
took
one
of
the
curtains
,
twisted
it
into
a
rope
,
and
pushed

I

end
through
the
bars
.
This
end
he
brought
out
four
bars
off
,
and
around
these
four
bars
he
wound
both
curtains
,
one
When
the
curtains
were
entirely
wound
in
this
way
,
he
inserted
the
heavy
iron
rod
between
the
folds
,
at
the
two
central
bars
,
and
began
to
turn
it
end
over
end
like
a
lever
.
The
first
turn
made
the
silken
rope
rigid
;
the
second
strained
it
;
the
third
called
out
all
the
muscular
power
of
the
man
.
But
there
was
nothing
gained
.
Mr.
Wyville
turned
,
and
looked
towards
Haggett
,
who
approached
.
Both
men
.
seized
the
iron
lever
,
and
pulled
it
down
with
all
their
force
.
"
This
is
a
convict's
trick
,
"
said
Haggett
,
as
they
paused
for
breath
.
Mr.
Wyville
made
nor
reply
,
but
continued
the
tremendous
leverage
.
There
was
a
cry
from
the
convicts
:
they

the
massive
bars

--
the
two
outer
bars
bending
towards
the
centre
under
the
terrific
strain
.
Once
again
the
upper
end
of
the
lever
was
seized
by
both
men
,
and
with
a
united
effort
of
strength
pulled
and
pressed
down
.
The
next
turn
was
easily
made
;
the
mighty
bars
had
bent
like
lead
in
the
centre
and
then
broken
,
leaving
two
gaps
wide
enough
to
allow
the
entrance
of

When
this
was
done
,
Mr.
Wyville
and
Mr.
Haggett
fell
back
,
while
the
officers
and
sailors
dashed
into
the
burning
cage
,
smothering
the
flames
with
wet
sails

they

.
The
vessel
was
saved
,
and
not
one
minute
could
have
been
spared

that
followed
