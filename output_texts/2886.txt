the
horsemen
passed
on
.
They
arrived
at
the
little
town
of
Pinjarra
Next
morning
,
they
found
that
Draper
had
arrived
.
Mr.
Wyville
arranged
with
the
innkeeper
and
his
wife
for
Harriet's
good
treatment
,
and
also
that
a
stockman's
team
,
which
was
going
to
Bunbury
,
should
offer
to
take
them
so
far
on
their
way
.
It
was
a
long
and
fatiguing
ride
for
the
horsemen
that
day
,

They
stopped
in
Bunbury
two
days
.
Mr.
Wyville
spending
his
time
in
the
prison
depot
,
instructing
the
chief
warder
in
the
new
system
.
They
found
Ngarra
-
jil
there
,
with
fresh
horses
.
He
was
to
ride
with
them
next
day
towards
the
Vasse
.
As
they
were
leaving
the
town
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
,
they
met
a
gang
of
wood
-
cutters
,
carrying
bundles
on
their
backs
,
coming
in
from
the
bush
.
"
Are
you
going
to
the
Vasse
?
"
asked
one
a
"
Yes

"
of
the
wood

cutters

who
was
resting
by
the
roadside
.
"
Well
,
keep
to
the
eastward
of
the
Koagulup
Swamp
and
salt
marshes
.
The
fire
is
all
along
the
other
side
.
We've
been
burnt
out
that
up
way
.
"
"
They
thanked
him
,
and
rode
on
.
Presently
,
another
man
shouted
after
them
--
"
There's
a
man
and
woman
gone
on
in
danger
.
"
before
you
,
and
if
they
take
the
road
to
the
right
of
the
swamp
,
they'll
be
They
rode
rapidly
,
striking
in
on
a
broad
,
straight
road
,
which
had
been
cleared
by
the
convicts
many
years
before
.
Mr.
Wyville
was
silent
and
preoccupied
.
Once
or
twice
Hamerton
made
some
passing
remark
,
but
he
did
not
hear
.
The
atmosphere
was
dense
with
the
low
-
lying
smoke
,
and
the
heat
was
almost
intolerable
.
A
few
miles
south
of
Bunbury
,
the
road
cut
clear
across
a
hill
.
From
the
summit
,
they
caught
their
first
sight
of
the
fire
.
Mr.
Wyville
reined
his
horse
,
and
Hamerton
and
the
bushman
followed
his
example
.
Before
them
stretched
a
vast
sea
of
smoke
,
level
,
dense
,
and
grayish
white
,
unbroken
,
save
here
and
there
by
the
topmost
branches
of
tall
trees
,
that
rose
clear
above
the
rolling
cloud
that
covered
all
below
.
"
This
is
Bunbury
racecourse
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
;
"
the
light
sea
-
breeze
keeps
the
smoke
down
,
and
rolls
it
away
to
the
eastward
.
This
fire
is
extensive
.
"
"
Where
is
our
road
now
?
"
asked
Hamerton
.
"
Through
the
smoke
,
the
fire
had
not
yet
reached
the
plain
.
See
:
it
is
just
seizing
the
trees
yonder
as
it
comes
from
the
valley
.
"
Hamerton
looked
far
to
the
westward
,
and
saw
the
sheeted
flame
,
fierce
red
with
ghastly
streaks
of
yellow
,
y
the
trees
in
waves
of
terrific
length
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
realized
the
power
as
on
a
living
and
sentient
destroyer
.
hungrily
leaping
among
of
the
element
.
It
appalled
him
,
if
he
were
looking
"
We
must
ride
swiftly
here
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
beginning
the
descent
;
"
but
the
plain
is
only
three
miles
wide
.
"
In
a
minute
they
had
plunged
into
the
murky
air
,
and
,
with
heads
bent
,
drove
their
horses
into
a
hard
gallop
.
But
the
animals
understood
,
and
needed
a
little
pressing
.
With
ears
laid
back
,
as
if
stricken
with
terror
,
they
flew
,
swift
-
footed
.
The
air
was
not
so
deadly
as
the
first
breath
suggested
.
The
dense
smoke
was
thickest
overhead
,
beneath
was
a
stratum
of
semi
-
pure
air
.
The
heat
was
far
,
more
dangerous
than
the
fumes
.
of
profound
relief

At
last
they
reached
the
rising
ground
again
,
and

lungs

was
now
changed
,
and
for
the
better
.
The
fire
in
their
front
appeared
only
on
the
right
of
the
road
.
It
stretched
in
a

rocky
share

ran

as
far
as
they
could

combined
roar

It

there
by
a
salt
marsh

"
said
Mr.
Wyville
;
"
but
that

some
miles
in

front
.
"
"
Koagulup
there

"
said
Ngarra
-
jil
,
meaning
that
where
the
marsh
ended
the
great
swamp
began
.
The
wood-
cutters
had
warned
them
to
keep
to
the
left
of
the
swamp
.
"
We
must
surely
overtake
those
travellers
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
to
Hamerton
,
"
and
before
they
reach
the
swamp
.
They
might
take
the
road
to
the
right
,
and
be
lost
.
"
They
galloped
forward
again
,
and
as
they
rode
,
in
the
falling
dusk
of
night
,
the
fire
on
the
right
increased
to
