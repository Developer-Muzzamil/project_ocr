giving
vent
to
the
pent
up
excitement
of
the
moment
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
turning
in
the
crowd
,
met
the
eyes
of
Haggett
earnestly
fixed
on
his
face
.
He
had
often
observed
his
watchfulness
before
;
but
there
was
another
meaning
in
his
eyes
to
-
day
Without
a
word
Mr.
Wyville
put
out
his
hand
which
Haggett
grimly
seized
.
"
Thank
"
&
you
'
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
That's
not
right
,
"
said
Haggett
,
"
you
have
saved
all
our
lives
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
negatively
shook
his
head
,
with
his
usual
grave
smile
,
and
was
about
to
slowly
let
pass
an
Mr.
Haggett
go
his
hand
,
still
looking
at
him
with
the
same
strange
expression
.
They
had
parted
a
few
paces
,
when
Haggett
strade
after
Mr.
Wyville
with
a
new
impulse
,
seized
his
hand
once
more
in
a
grip
of
iron
,
and
met
his
eye
.
with
a
face
working
in
strong
emotion
,
every
possible
reef
in
his
immense
lips
quivering
with
suppressed
feeling
"
Forgive
me
!
"
he
said
,
and
without
another
word
he
dropped
Mr.
Wyville's
hand
,
turned
,
and
strode
off
to
his
room
by
the
other
side
of
the
ship
.
That
night
,
when
the
excitement
had
died
,
and
the
usual
quiet
had
been
restored
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
and
Sheridan
walked
the
poop
for
hours
.
Mr.
Wyville
made
no
mention
of
Haggett's
strange
conduct
.
Towards
midnight
they
went
to
their
rooms
.
The
extra
-
ordinary
events
of
the
day
bad
kept
them
from
talking
about
Captain
Draper
,
though
the
subject
had
been
for
days
uppermost
in
both
minds
.
When
Mr.
Wyville
entered
his
room
,
his
eyes
fell
on
a
letter
,
fixed
endwise
on
his
table
to
attract
his
attention
.
It
was
addressed
to
him
.
He
opened
it
,
and
took
out
a
photograph
--
the
portrait
of
a
convict
in
chains
.
There
was
no
other
enclosure
.
On
the
back
of
it
were
written
these
words
,
in
Mr.
Haggett's
dated
four
years
!
back
:
--
"
This
is
the
only
photograph
of
the
man
known
as
MOONDYNE
.
It
was
taken
in
West
Australia
,
just
before
his
latest
escape
from
Fremantle
Prison
.
All
other
photographs
of
this
prisoner
have
unaccountably
disappeared
from
the
prison
books
.
'
Mr.
Wyville
gazed
a
long
time
at
the
strange
present
.
Then
he
laid
it
on
the
table
,
locked
his
door
,
and
walked
meditatively
to
and
fro
his
narrow
room
.
At
times
he
would
stop
and
take
the
picture
from
the
table
,
look
at
it
with
deep
attention
,
while
his
lips
moved
as
if
he
were
addressing
it
.
At
last
he
took
the
portrait
,
tore
it
to
pieces
,
and
,
opening
the
window
of
his
room
,
threw
the
pieces
into
the
sea
.
DEAD
SEA
FRUIT
.
FROM
the
moment
that
Will
Sheridan
had
recognized
Draper
in
the
captain
of
the
Houguemont
,
his
mind
was
filled
with
an
acute
fear
that
Alice
Walmsley
might
suddenly
I
came
face
to
face
with
the
wretch
who
had
blighted
her
existence
.
Such
a
meeting
might
be
fatal
-
-
it
certainly
would
be
,
grievous
.
It
was
the
sudden
touch
of
this
fear
that
made
Sheridan
walk
so
quickly
to
his
room
on
the
night
of
the
recognition
.
It
came
like
a
flash
;
and
he
deemed
it
best
to
consider
his
course
of
action
calmly
.
Sailor
as
he
was
,
he
knew
that
the
commander
of
a
ship
,
usually
had
absolute
power
over
all
on
board
.
He
had
observed
,
however
,
that
Mr.
Wyville
,
an
one
or
two
occasions
,
had
assumed
an
authority
in
certain
matters
relating
to
the
prisoners
.
This
gave
him
comfort
.
In
case
Draper
recognized
Alice
Walmsley
on
the
ship
,
that
instant
,
Sheridan
resolved
,
he
would
make
known
the
whole
terrible
story
to
Mr.
Wyville
,
and
avert
intended
evil
,
if
possible
by
fear
,
if
necessary
by
force
.
Meanwhile
,
Sheridan
saw
Sister
Cecilia
,
who
knew
that
he
was
an
old
friend
of
the
innocent
and
much-
wronged
girl
,
and
requested
her
to
keep
Alice
at
all
times
off
the
main
deck
.
He
gave
no
reason
request
"
But
,
Mr.
Sheridan
,
"
said
the
nun
,
for
the
thinking
of
Alice's
health
,
"
she
must
come
into
the
open
air
some
time
.
"
It
were
better
not
-
-better
not
,
"
answered
Sheridan
,
in
a
troubled
mind
;
"
it
were
better
that
she
should
remain
all
day
in
the
hospital
.
"
"
In
the
hospital
,
"
repeated
the
wise
little
nun
,
with
a
pitying
smile
.
She
evidently
saw
,
more
.
clearly
than
anyone
on
board
,
the
strange
complications
around
her
.
The
hearts
of
at
least
four
of
the
principal
actors
in
the
sorrowful
drama
were
open
to
her
eyes
;
she
saw
the
relations
of
Sheridan
,
Alice
,
the
miserable
Harriet
Draper
,
and
her
guilty
husband
.
But
even
Sister
Cecilia
,
wise
as
she
was
,
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
fifth
heart
deeply
concerned
in
the
play
.
As
she
repeated
Sheridan's
words
,
her
pitying
smile
died
away
into
lines
of
sorrow
,
seeing
how
blindly
he
would
turn
Alice's
steps
from
.
one
danger
to
a
deeper
one
.
She
recalled
,
too
,
at
the
word
,
the
supreme
desolation
and
misery
of
that
one
who
now
spent
her
days
in
the
hospital
.
"
Do
not
fear
,
Mr.
Sheridan
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
went
on
her
way
of
mercy
,
"
Alice
will
be
safe
.
She
will
remain
in
