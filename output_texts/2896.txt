the

room
,
and
,
opening
the
French
windows
,
to
us
.
How
that
scene
comes
back
to
me
even
sang
moon
shining
upon
now
!
We
three
—
Wakefield
,
Cecil
,
and
I
on
low
garden
chairs
on
the
lawn
,
with
the
full
,
the
river
flowing
within
a
few
yards
of
us
,
and
the
faint
odour
of
roses
and
mignonette
which
reached
us
from
the
side
of
the
walk
.
Above
all
,
that
rich
,
clear
,
musical
voice
,
singing
some
old
German
love
.
came
rose
,
songs
the
tune
of
;
and
strolled
the
garden
my
senses
She
which
haunts
me
still
.
Then
she
Eva-
forth
to
join
us
again
,
and
we
all
chatted
in
low
tones
,
as
if
fearing
to
break
the
charm
of
the
scene
by
loudness
or
jarring
laughter
.
Last
of
all
,
when
Cecil
and
old
Wakefield
were
deep
in
some
question
of
ancient
Egyptian
history
,
Eva
and
I
,
together
.
What
our
conversation
was
,
what
I
said
to
her
,
I
could
never
recall
.
I
only
know
that
,
seemed
intoxicated
,
and
in
every
word
of
mine
,
and
with
every
glance
,
I
betrayed
my
sudden
passion
.
seemed
startled
at
first
,
as
well
she
might
be
,
and
looked
at
me
with
those
wondrous
eyes
filled
with
a
half-
macking
,
half
-
tender
,
light
,
till
I
almost
went
wild
,
and
several
times
I
nearly
burst
out
with
my
passionate
love
,
and
nothing
but
the
fear
of
the
deserved
rebuke
for
so
abrupt
a
wooing
restrained
me
.
At
last
came
the
time
for
Cecil
and
me
to
retire
to
our
rooms
.
There
was
no
sleep
for
me
that
night
.
I
threw
.
little
latticed
window
,
and
sat
for
hours
gazing
at
the
stars
and
moon
,
and
down
at
the
silvery
river
flowing
beneath
,
and
when
I
turned
at
last
to
my
bed
,
it
was
still
not
to
sleep
,
but
to
build
of
which
Eva
was
the
central
figure
.
came
and
passed
,
all
too
swiftly
for
,
me
up
tale
of
open
the
dreams
of
a
future
,
in
all
;
but
before
it
was
over
I
had
hinted
of
my
love
to
Eva
,
"
The
next
day
and
she
had
confessed
that
she
might
,
in
time
,
return
it
.
"
We
went
back
early
on
Monday
morning
,
but
I
had
made
arrangements
to
see
Eva
often
,
and
felt
wildly
,
rapturously
happy
.
Every
day
I
rowed
down
to
her
home
,
and
she
met
me
in
the
meadows
,
and
,
fastening
up
my
y
boat
,
I
used
to
spend
hours
with
her
,
roaming
about
,
indulging
in
all
the
usual
lovers
'
rhapsodies
,
and
uttering
all
the
lovers
'
platitudes
.
Well
,
;
no
doubt
the
matter
would
have
ended
in
the
stereotyped
way
;
when
I
came
e
of
age
we
should
have
been
married
,
but
her
father
suddenly
died
of
heart
disease
.
A
tearful
note
summoned
me
early
y
one
morning
to
her
house
,
where
I
found
her
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief
over
his
dead
body
.
I
took
up
my
quarters
at
the
village
inn
,
and
never
left
her
until
the
funeral
was
over
.
Then
we
spoke
about
the
future
,
and
she
told
me
that
,
beside
myself
,
she
had
scarcely
a
friend
or
relation
in
the
world
.
I
marrying
her
,
of
course
;
but
this
she
would
not
hear
of
.
Would
to
God
I
had
insisted
on
it
!
"
looked
up

The
lawyer
with
a
quick
glance
of
surprise
,
which

into

of
earnest
interest
as
Mr.
2
for
what
followed
,
"
he
said
slowly
.
"
The
Very
y
devil
must
have
tempted
me
,
for
I
swear
that
"
I
have
no
excuse
.
never
ance
had
the
thought
entered
into
my
head
of
treating
her
in
any
other
way
than
as
my
affianced
wife
.
I

what
nor
ignorance
as
my
excuse

and
inexperienced
,
it
is
true
,
but
I
can
plead
neither

followed
.
I
loved
her
fondly
,
and
we
were
alone
in
the
world
together
,
and
alas
!
I
forgot
all
else
but
the
loving
her
.
In
mere
thoughtlessness
I
committed
the
one
blackguardly
action
of
my
life
.
Well
,
"
he
continued
with
a
sigh
,
"
repentance
now
is
useless
.
One
thing
,
however
,
I
repeat
.
I
always
meant
to
marry
her
,
and
but
for
the
subsequent
horrible
events
I
would
have
done
it
.
"
We
went
to
London
and
took
a
house
in
Upper
Sleeke
Street
,
and
there
I
met
Cecil
Braithwaite
again
.
We
became
constant
companions
.
I
often
had
to
run
down
here
to
see
about
matters
connected
with
the
estate
.
One
evening
,
when
I
had
intended
coming
,
and
had
left
word
with
Eva
that
I
should
not
be
home
,
I
missed
the
train
,
and
,
meeting
Cecil
,
dropped
into
the
club
with
him
.
'
By
-
the
-
bye
,
'
he
said
,
as
we
were
chatting
in
the
smoke
-
room
,
you
never
told
me
that
your
wife
had
a
brother
.
'
'
Never
,
for
the
good
reason
,
old
fellow
,
that
she
has
none
,
'
I
answered
,
hiding
my
surprise
with
mirthfulness
;
'
she
was
an
vonly
child
.
'
He
looked
at
me
.
rather
curiously
for
a
moment
or
two
,
smoking
on
in
silence
.
"
What
do
you
mean
?
'
I
said
.
He
made
some
evasive
reply
,
and
immediately
afterwards
muttered
an
excuse
about
an
appointment
,
which
I
knew
to
be
false
,
and
до
But
I
would
not
let
him
leave
me
until
he
had
explained
his
question
,
and
with
an
ill
resumed
his
seat
.
For
some
time
he
would
tell
me
nothing
,
but
rose
to
l
grace
.
he
my
earnestness
at
last
prevailed
,
and
he
told
me
with
great
reluctance
that
which
drove
me
almost
frantic
to
hear
.
"
It
seemed
that
he
had
friends
in
Upper
Sleeke
Street
,
living
almost
apposite
to
me
,
whom
he
often
visited
,
and
on
two
occasions
,
when
I
was
away
,
he
had
seen
a
man
enter
my
house
whom
my
wife
always
admitted
herself
,
and
who
stopped
there
several
hours
.
Once
,
when
the
blinds
had
been
left
up
..
he
had
seen
this
man
and
my
wife
in
amiable
,
not
to
say
affectionate
conversation
,
and
—
but
I
cannot
tell
y
I
you
all
I
learnt
!
This
was
enough
for
me
.
I
asked
him
at
what
time
this
took
place
,
and
he
told
me
about
twelve
,
after
the
servants
were
sa
abed
.
While
we
were
talking
,
the
hall
-
porter
brought
,
me
a
letter
from
the
rack
The
handwriting
was
strange
,
s
I
tore
it
open
mechanically
.
It
was
an
anonymous
letter
,
and
one
of
the
most
cruel
I
ever
read
.
As
far
as
I
can
remember
,
these
words
were
scrawled
in
a
disguised
hand
on
half
a
sheet
of
paper
:
