"
No
,
sir
,
no
none
as
can't
though
,
get
along
without
me
.
I'ave
lived
here
alone
for
fifteen
year
..
I
don't
know
a
man

in
Walton
to
take
my
place

There's
a
deal
of
trust
in
this
hoffice
,
sir
,
a
deal
of
trust
.
"
"
What
property
do
you
own
here
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
The
donkey
and
water
-
cart
is
mine
,
though
the
village
gave
'
em
to
me
.
That's
all
the
property
.
"
"
I
need
a
careful
man
to
oversee
a
settlement
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
But
he
will
have
to
go
to
Australia
.
He
will
be
comfortably
placed
,
much
more
so
than
you
are
here
;
and
his
engagement
will
be
permanent
.
I
came
to
offer
the
place
to
you
--
can
you
come
?
"
"
Yessir
,
"
said
Officer
Lodge
,
as
quietly
as
if
he
were
asked
to
walk
down
the
street
.
"
Do
you
want
me
to
start
now
?
"
It
is
now
noon
;
I
will
return
to
London
on
the
two
o'clock
train
.
Meanwhile
,
I
will
walk
through
the
village
.
"
Turning
to
Ngarra
-
jil
,
Mr.
Wyville
said
in
his
own
language
,
"
You
can
remain
here
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
walked
straight
to
the
old
home
of
Alice
Walmsley
,
and
lingered
a
long
time
in
and
around
the
deserted
and
decaying
cottage
.
There
was
a
warm
feeling
in
his
heart
,
a
new
and
happy
growth
,
which
was
thrilled
and
strengthened
as
his
eye
fell
on
objects
that
might
.
t
once
have
been
familiar
to
Alice
Walmsley
:
As
he
left
the
place
,
to
return
for
Officer
Lodge
,
it
seemed
as
dear
to
him
as
if
he
had
known
and
loved
it
all
his
life
.
He
turned
towards
it
,
as
he
walked
down
the
road
,
and
there
was
a
quiet
gladness
in
his
face
.
"
She
will
leave
it
all
behind
,
"
he
murmured
.
"
There
shall
be
no
picture
of
its
wretchedness
in
her
memory
.
"
He
passed
to
the
court
-
house
.
Officer
Lodge
and
Ngarra
-
jil
were
sitting
in
the
office
,
silently
looking
at
each
other
.
At
first
,
Officer
Lodge
had
spoken
to
his
companion
;
but
Ngarra
-
jil
had
answered
only
by
a
gruff
and
unintelligible
2
monosyllable
.
Then
they
had
subsided
into
perfect
silence
.
"
Are
you
ready
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Yessir
.
"
"
Come
.
"
They
went
to
the
rail

way
station
,
and
took
their
seats
for
London
:
Officer
Lodge
and
Ngarra
-
jil
sat
opposite
each
other
,
and
continued
their
acquaintance
in
the
same
silent
fashion
which
had
marked
its
beginning
in
the
stationhouse
.
On
board
the
convict
ship
,
they
had
attracted
the
lonely
Mr.
Haggett
,
who
,
in
a
patronizing
manner
at
first
,
joined
their
company
.
As
these
three
stood
near
the
bow
of
the
Houguemont
,
looking
up
at
the
purple
cliffs
of
lofty
Pico
,
there
rose
an
extraordinary
commotion
on
the
deck
among
the
convicts
.

They
had
first
been
sentenced
to
work
at

;
but
they
sat
within
the
bars
idle
,
staring
out
at
the
crowd
of
convicts
on
deck
,
and
singing
and
shouting
.
For
this
they
had
been
again
reported
,
and
the
officers
had
now
come
to
take
them
out
for
further
punishment
.
The
officers
stood
waiting
for
him
who
had
the
key
of
the
barred
door
;
and
he
was
searching
vainly
in
his
pockets
.
After
a
while
,
it
was
evident
that
the
key
had
been
mislaid
or
lost
.
The
officers
could
not

The
two
culprits
within
were
the
first
to
understand
this
,
and
they
set
up
a
howl
of
derision
.
They
danced
about
in
their
den
,
cursing
the
officers
and
snapping
their
fingers
at
them
through
the
bars
.
At
length
a
dreadful
idea
struck
one
.
of
the
desperate
wretches
.
His
e
eye
had
fallen
on
the
heap
of
loosely-
picked
oakum
inside
the
bars
.
With
a
yell
he
seized
an
armful
of
the
inflammable
material
and
threw
it
far

the
cage
,
against

The
officers
stood
outside
,
watching
the
fellow's
action
with
alarm
.
When
he
had
gathered
all
the
oakum
into
eyes
with
a
grin
of
a
pile
,
he
drew
from

pocket

suddenly
at

of

,
gave

and

.
"
Damn
you
!
"
he
cried
,
shaking
his
fist
at
the
powerless
warders
,
"
you
can't
help

We'll
set
fire
to

"
The
dreadful
threat
struck
terror
into
the
convicts
on
deck
,
who
began
to
huddle
together
like
sheep
.
The
officers
looked
into
each
other's
pale
faces
,
dumb
and
helpless
.
One
of
them
caught
hold
of
the
massive
bars
of

door

and
shook
them
with

officers
