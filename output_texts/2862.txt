the
sickness
.
In
his
fantasy
he
was
standing
by
the
rail
of
the
ship
,
while
a
boat
was
slowly
lowered
,
in
which
sat
Sheridan
.
As
the
boat
swung
over
the
raging
sea
,
suspended
by
a
rope
at
bow
and
stern
,
the
bow
.
parted
,
the
boat
fell
perpendicularly
,
and
Sheridan
was
flung
into
the
ocean
,
and
drowned
.
During
this
series
of
mental
pictures
,
the
action
of
the
raving
rope
;
man
rope
plainly
showed
that
his
hand
had
cut
the
;
and
his
exultation
at
the
completion
of
the
murder
was
horrible
to
see
.
He
would
turn
his
face
to
the
partition
,
away
from
the
light
,
and
chuckle
with
a
vile
sound
,
rubbing
his
hands
in
devilish
delight
.
One
day
Mr.
Wyville
sat
beside
the
bed
,
intending
to
relieve
the
tireless
Harriet
for
a
few
hours
.
But
Harriet
still
lingered
in
the
room
.
Draper
had
gone
once
more
through
the
hideous
pantomime
,
accompanying
every
act
with
words
expressing
the
baleful
intention
.
Mr.
Wyville
sat
regarding
him
with
compressed
lips
.
When
the
horrible
culmination
had
come
,
and
the
wretch
chuckled
over
his
success
,
"

Mr.
Wyville
looked
1
up
and
met
Harriet's
fearful
gaze
.
"
Curse
him
!
"
whispered
Draper
,
"
he
was
always
in
my
way
.
I
meant
it
always
--
but
this
was
the
best
plan
.
Ha
!
ha
!
better
than
pistol
or
poison
--
accident
--
ha
!
ha
!
drowned
by
accident
!
"
"
Do
you
i
know
of
whom
be
speaks
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
of
Harriet
.
"
A
man
named
Sheridan
,
"
she
answered
;
he
talks
of
him
a
great
deal
.
"
"
A
man
named
Sheridan
!
"
repeated
Mr.
Wyville
to
himself
.
"
She
speaks
as
if
she
did
not
know
him
.
"
"
He
sat
silent
for
a
time
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
guilty
!
man
before
him
,
who
was
unconsciously
laying
bare
the
foul
secrets
of
his
heart
.
At
last
he
turned
to
Harriet
and
said
-
-
"
Do
you
not
know
this
man
named
Sheridan
?
"
"
No.
"
The
answer
surprised
him
,
and
he
became
silent
again
.
Presently
he
sent
Harriet
to
her
rest
.
"
I
do
not
see
the
end
,
"
he
wearily
murmured
,
when
he
was
alone
with
the
sick
man
;
"
but
I
forebode
darkly
.
Providence
has
kept
this
miscreant
from
a
deeper
crime
than
he
has
yet
committed
.
Heaven
grant
that
he
has
also
been
preserved
for
repentance
and
atonement
!
"
Mr.
Wyville
had
resolved
to
be
at
Draper's
side
when
the
hour
of
sanity
returned
,
and
to
keep
his
unfortunate
wife
out
of
sight
until
he
had
prepared
him
for
her
presence
.
It
was
midnight
when
that
moment
arrived
.
Draper
had
slept
soundly
for
several
hours
.
Mr.
Wyville
first
knew
that
he
had
returned
to
consciousness
by
the
movement
of
his
hands
.
Presently
he
spoke
,
in
a
feeble
voice
.
"
I
have
been
sick
,
haven't
I
?
How
"
Six
days
.
"
"
Are
we
still
becalmed
?
many
days
?
"
"
No
,
we
are
in
the
Southern
trades
.
"
Draper
said
no
more
.
He
moved
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
trying
to
look
around
the
room
.
Mr.
Wyville
remained
still
and
silent
.
"
Have
you
been
here
with
me
?
"
he
asked
,
at
length
.
"
You
couldn't
have
been
here
all
the
time
.
"
"
Not
all
the
time
.
"
suppose
"
"
I
I
spoke
aloud
,
and
--
and--
raved
about
people
?
"
Mr.
Wyville
looked
suddenly
at
him
,
and
caught
the
reptilian
eye
that
watched
the
effect
of
the
was
impelled
to
speak
sooner
than
he
had
intended
,
by
the
cunning
of
the
fellow
.
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
keeping
his
powerful
look
on
Draper's
face
,
as
if
he
addressed
his
inner
soul
as
well
as
question
He

sense
;
"
you
have
told
the
whole
villainous
purpose
of
your

heart

If
you

,
thank
God
you
may
for
striking

,
nothing
could
have
saved
you
;
for
there
are
others

your

Draper
did
not
answer
,
but
lay
like
a
scotched
snake
,
perfectly
still
,
hardly
breathing
,
but
watching
Mr.
Wyville
with
a
cold
"
Do
you
"
eye
.
know
who
has
nursed
you
through
your
sickness
?
"
Draper
moved
his
head
negatively
.
"
Would
you
like
to
know
?
"
He
only
looked
more
|
keenly
at
Mr.
Wyville
,
but
there
was
a
light
of
alarm
in
the
look
.
"
You
have
been
cared
for
by
one
whom
you
have
blighted
who
owed
you
nothing
but
curses
.
Day
and
night
she
has
been
with
you
,
and
she
has
saved
your
life

"
raper
Still
D
did
not
move
or
speak
,
but
only
looked
.
"
You
know
of
whom
I

said
Mr.
Wyville
;
forgiveness

"
are
you
ready
now
to
meet
your
unhappy
wife
,
and
to
ask
