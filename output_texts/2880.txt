Beneath
the
poop
awning
,
waving
,
their
handkerchiefs
to
friends
on
shore
,
stood
Mrs.
Little
and
several
other
ladies
.
Standing
with
them
,
but
waving
no
adieu
,
was
Alice
Walmsley
;
and
,
quietly
sitting
near
her
,
enjoying
the
excitement
and
pleasure
of
the
others
,
was
Sister
Cecilia
.
There
were
many
gentlemen
on
board
,
too
,
including
the
stiff
old
Governor
of
the
colony
,
and
several
of
his
staff
.
Mr.
Wyville
stood
with
the
Governor
,
pointing
out
,
as
they
passed
,
something
of
interest
on
the
native
prison
-
isle
of
Rottenest
;
Mr.
Hamerton
lounged
on
the
forecastle
,
smoking
and
with
him
the
artillery
officer
of
Fremantle
,
while
Mr.
Sheridan
leant
over
the
rail
,
watching
the
sea
,
but
often
raising
his
head
and
looking
sternwards
,
seeking
the
eyes
t
that
invariably
turned
,
as
if
by
instinet
,
to
meet
his
glance
.
It
was
a
party
of
pleasure
and
inspection
,
going
to
the
Vasse
,
to
visit
the
new
settlement
purchased
from
Mr.
Wyville
by
Mr.
Sheridan
.
They
proposed
to
steam
slowly
along
the
coast
,
and
reach
their
destination
in
two
days
.
The
excursion
was
a
relief
to
Mr.
Wyville
,
after
the
severe
strain
he
had
borne
for
months
.
From
the
day
of
the
threatened
mutiny
,
which
he
had
quelled
by
the
report
,
the
new
law
had
become
an
assured
success
,
and
the
congratulations
and
thanks
of
the
whole
colony
had
poured
in
on
t
the
Comptroller
-
General
.
It
appeared
to
those
who
knew
him
best
,
that
,
during
the
period
of
trial
,
he
had
withdrawn
more
and
more
from
social
life
,
and
had
increased
his
silence
and
reserve
.
This
change
was
ascribed
to
the
anxiety
he
felt
for
the
reform
of
the
penal
law
.
In
his
conversation
,
too
,
even
Hamerton
admitted
that
he
had
become
almost
irritable
on
personal
or
local
topics
,
and
was
only
willing
to
converse
on
abstract
or
speculative
ideas
.
"
The
individual
withers
,
and
the
world
is
more
and
more
,
'
quoted
Hamerton
one
.
day
as
the
subject
of
Mr.
Wyville's
reserve
was
quietly
discussed
on
the
poop
.
"
I
don't
know
what
he
will
do
for
a
cause
,
now
that
his
penal
law
has
succeeded
.
"
"
"
He
will
turn
his
attention
to
politics
,
I
think
,
"
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
staff
;
"
every
patriotic
man
has
a
field
there
.
"
There
was
a
pause
,
as
if
all
were
considering
"
Can
you
call
Mr.
Wyville
a
patriot
?
"
the
At
proposition
.
length
Hamerton
spoke
.
"
Every
Englishman
is
a
patriot
,
"
answered
the
first
speaker
;
"
of
course
he
is
one
.
"
Again
there
was
a
lapse
;
and
again
Hamerton
was
the
first
to
speak
.
"
I
don't
like
the
word
--
applied
to
him
.
I
don't
think
it
fits
,
somehow
.
"
"
Surely
,
it
is
a
noble
word
,
only
to
be
given
to
a
noble
character
,
"
said
one
of
the
ladies
.
"
Well
,
"
drawled
Hamerton
,
assenting
,
but
still
dissatisfied
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
has
the
two
highest
characteristics
of
an
Englishman
,
"
said
the
old
Governor
,
sententiously
.
"
Which
are
?
"
queried
Hamerton
.
"
Patriotism
,
and
love
of
Law
.
"
There
was
an
expression
of
approval
from
almost
every
one
but
Hamerton
,
who
still
grumbled
.
The
Governor
was
highly
pleased
with
himself
for
his
prompt
reply
.
"
Are
these
not
the
noblest
principles
for
an
Englishman
,
or
any1
man
?
"
he
asked
exultingly
"
Let
us
leave
it
to
Mr.
Wyville
himself
,
"
said
Hamerton
;
"
here
he
comes
.
"
"
We
have
been
discussing
public
virtues
,
"
said
the
Governor
to
Mr.
Wyville
,
who
now
joined
the
we
appeal
to
you
for
a
decision
.
Are
not
Patriotism
and
love
of
Law
two
great
English
virtues

"
"
English
virtues-
;
I
think
so
;
"
and
Mr.
Wyville
smiled
as
he
gave
the
answer
.
-yes
,
"
But
are
they
virtues
in
the
abstract
?

Hamerton

company
.
.
The
answer
,
given
in
a
grave
voice
,
was
utterly
There
was
a
movement
of
surprise
in
the
unexpected
.
The
old
Governor
coughed
.
once
or
twice
,
as
if
preparing
to
make
a
reply
;
but
he
did
not
.
Patriotism
not
a
virtue
at
length
exclaimed
one
of
the
ladies
.
"
Pray
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
what
is
it
,
then
?
"
Mr.
Wyville
paused
a
moment
,
then
told
a
a
story
"
There
were
ten
families
living
.
on
a
beautiful
island
,
and
owning
the
whole
of
it
.
They
might
have
lived
together
in
fraternal
peace
and
love
;
but
each
family
preferred
to
keep
to
themselves
,
neither
feeling
pride
nor
pleasure
in
the
good
of
their
neighbours
,
nor
caring
about
the
general
welfare
of
the
whole
number
.
They
watched
their
own
interests
with
greedy
care
;
and
when
they
were
strong
enough
they
robbed
their
fellow's
,
and
boasted
of
the
deed
.
Every
person
of
each
family
was
proud
of
its
doings
,
though
many
of
these
were
disgraceful
.
The
spirit
which
filled
these
people
was
,
I
think
,
patriotism
--
on
a
small
scale
.
"
"
Good
!
"
said
Hamerton
,
looking
,
at
the
Governor
;
"
I
thought
that
word
didn't
fit
,
somehow
.
'
"
Well
,
if
patriotism
is
to
be
condemned
,
shall
we
not
still
reverence
Law
?
"
asked
someone
.
"

Wyville
