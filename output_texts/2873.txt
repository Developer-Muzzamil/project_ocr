"
I
love
all
the
world
better
for
the
sweet
rose
-
bud
I
you
gave
me
in
prison
,
"
she
said
.
Sister
Cecilia
seemed
puzzled
for
a
moment
,
and
then
she
smiled
as
"
It
was
not
I
who
gave
you
that
rose
-
bud
,
Alice
.
"
if
she
recalled
something
Alice's
face
became
blank
with
disappointment
;
her
hands
sank
on
her
knees
.
"
O
,
do
not
say
that
it
was
left
there
by
accident
or
by
careless
hands
.
I
cannot
think
of
that
.
I
have
drawn
so
kind
heart
had
read
my
unhappiness
,
and
had
discovered
such
a
much
comfort
from
the
belief
that
sweet
means
your
s
of
sending
comfort
.
Do
not
break
down
my
fancies
now
.
If
you
did
not
give
it
me
,
you
prompted
the
act
?
You
knew
of
it
,
Sister
,
surely
you
did
?
"
No.
I
did
not
know
of
it
until
it
was
done
.
I
should
never
have
thought
of
it
.
It
was
thought
of
by
seems
devoted
to
others
and
to
the
Divine
Master
.
Do
not
fear
that
careless
hands
put
the
flower
in
one
whose
whole
life
se
your
cell
,
Alice
.
It
was
placed
there
by
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
"
By
Mr.
Wyville
!
"
"
Yes
dear
;
it
was
Mr.
Wyville's
own
plan
to
win
time
.
"
"
you
i
back
to
the
beautiful
world
.
I
thought
you
knew
it
all
the
;
how
could
Mr.
Wyville
have
known
?
"
There
was
a
new
earnestness
in
Alice's
"
It
was
nearly
five
years
ago
;
!
face
as
she
spoke
.
"
He
had
learned
your
history
in
Millbank
from
the
governor
and
the
books
;
and
he
became
deeply
interested
.
It
was
he
who
first
said
you
were
innocent
,
long
before
he
proved
it
;
and
it
was
he
who
first
asked
me
to
visit
cell
.
"
you
in
your
Alice
did
not
speak
,
but
she
listened
with
a
look
almost
of
sadness
,
yet
with
close
interest
.
"
He
was
your
friend
,
Alice
,
when
had
no
other
friend
I
in
the
world
,
"
continued
Sister
Cecilia
,
not
looking
at
you
Alice's
face
,
or
she
would
have
hesitated
;
"
for
four
years
!
whose
punishment
you
!
had
borne
so
long
.
"
"
Where
did
he
find
her
?
"
Alice
asked
,
after
a
pause
.
he
watched
I
your
case
,
until
at
last
he
found
her
"
He
found
her
in
the
jail
of
your
native
village
,
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
.
"
"
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
!
"
repeated
Alice
in
surprise
;
"
he
took
much
trouble
,
then
,
to
prove
that
I
was
innocent
.
"
"
Yes
;
and
he
did
it
all
alone
.
"
Very
lon
voice
.
"
Mr.
Sheridan
,
perhaps
,
could
have
assisted
him
.
He
was
born
in
Walton
,
"
said
Alice
in
a
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Sheridan
told
me
so
when
he
gave
me
the
package
for
you
at
Portland
;
but
he
was
here
in
Australia
all
the
2
years
Mr.
Wyville
was
searching
for
poor
wretched
Harriet
.
But
come
now
,
Alice
,
we
will
leave
that
gloomy
old
time
behind
us
in
England
.
Let
us
always
keep
it
there
,
as
our
Australian
day
looks
backward
and
sees
the
English
night
.
"
Soon
after
,
Alice
started
to
return
to
her
home
.
She
lingered
a
long
time
by
the
placid
river
,
the
particulars
she
had
beard
recurring
to
her
and
much
disturbing
her
peace
.
In
the
midst
of
her
reflections
she
heard
her
name
called
,
and
looking
towards
the
road
,
saw
Mr.
Wyville
.
She
did
move
,
and
he
approached
.
"
I
have
come
to
seek
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
to
prepare
you
to
meet
an
old
friend
.
"
She
looked
at
him
in
surprise
,
without
speaking
.
you
"
Mr.
Sheridan
has
just
returned
from
Adelaide
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
were
the
first
person
he
asked
for
.
I
was
not
aware
that
knew
him
.
you
!
There
was
no
tone
in
his
voice
that
betrayed
disquiet
or
anxiety
.
He
was
even
more
"
I
am
cheerful
than
usual
.
"
know
Mr.
Sheridan
,
"
he
continued
,
"
he
is
a
fine
fellow
;
and
I
fear
he
has
been
very
unhappy
.
"
"
i
glad
you
!
"
He
has
been
very
busy
,
"
she
said
,
looking
down
at
the
river
;
"
men
have
a
great
deal
to
distract
them
from
unhappiness
.
"
"
See
that
jagged
rock
beneath
the
water
,
"
he
said
,
pointing
to
a
stone
,
the
raised
point
of
which
broke
the
calm
surface
of
the
river
.
"
Some
poet
likens
a
man's
sorrow
to
such
a
stone
.
When
the
flood
comes
,
the
sweeping
rush
of
enterprise
or
duty
,
it
is
buried
;
but
in
the
calm
season
it
will
rise
again
to
cut
the
surface
,
like
an
ancient
pain
.
"
"
Alice
followed
the
simile
with
and
mind
.
eye
"
"
"
"
I
did
not
think
&
you
read
poetry
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
smile
,
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
on
the
rocks
.
"
I
have
not
read
much
,
"
he
said
--
and
his
face
was
flushed
in
the
setting
.
"
until
very
recently
.
"
As
they
walked
together
towards
the
house
,
Alice
returned
to
the
subject
first
in
her
mind
.
With
a
g
sun--
gravely
quiet
voice
she
said-
-
"
Mr.
Sheridan's
unhappiness
is
old
,
then
?
"
"
Yes
;
it
began
years
ago
,
when
he
was
little
more
than
a
boy
.
"
Alice
was
silent
.
She
walked
slowly
beside
Mr.
Wyville
for
a
dozen
steps
.
Then
she
stopped
,
as
if
unable
to
