The
alms
of
prayer
that
were
doled
out
by
the
nasal
Scripture
-
readers
had
long
since
been
carried
past
her
door
.
They
regarded
her
as
hopelessly
lost
.
She
never
spoke
her
dissent
;
but
they
could
see
that
she
did
not
hear
them
,
that
she
did
not
believe
them
.
So
they
left
her
to
herself
.
One
day
,
a
man
sat
in
the
governor's
office
with
a
large
book
before
him
,
in
which
he
had
been
carefully
reading
a
page
on
which
the
governor
,
standing
beside
him
,
had
placed
his
index
finger
.
"
"
"
"
It
is
a
remarkable
case
,
"
said
the
governor
,
"
and
she
certainly
is
not
insane
.
"
"
She
was
not
a
criminal
by
association
?
"
asked
the
visitor
,
closing
the
book
.
He
was
a
powerfully
built
,
dark-
faced
man
,
with
a
foreign
air
and
a
deep
voice
.
The
studied
respect
of
the
governor
proved
him
to
be
a
person
of
importance
.
It
,
was
Mr.
Wyville
,
who
had
recently
arrived
in
London
,
and
who
was
visiting
the
prisons
,
with
authority
from
the
Ministry
itself
.
a
sea
captain
.

"
No
,
"
said
the
governor
;
"
she
was
a
village
girl
,
wife
of
as
reports
-

entry
â€¢
The
police
didn't
know
her
.
"
"
She
has
never
defended
herself
,
nor
reproached
others
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Never
,
"
answered
the
governor
.
"
She
has
never
spoken
about
herself
.
"
"
It
is
very
strange
,
and
very
sad
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
to
the
governor
.
And
to
himself
he
murmured
,
"
She
must
have
suffered
fearful
wrong
.
"
Soon
after
,
in
governor
,
;
he
passed
along
the
corridor
,
and
stopped
at
Alice
Walmsley's
cell
.
The
warder
opened
the
door
.
Mr.
Wyville
did
not
look
at
the
prisoner
,
but
walked
across
the
cell
,
as
company
with
the
s
if
observing
the
window
bars
,
upon
which
he
laid
his
hand
.
"
The
iron
is
covered
with
rust
,
"
Wyville
said
to
the
repainting
.
"
governor
.
"
The
windows
of
this
range
certainly
need
Then
,
apparently
looking
round
in
the
same
practical
way
,
Mr.
Wyville
remained
,
perhaps
,
a
minute
in
the
cell
.
He
had
scarcely
turned
his
eyes
on
the
prisoner
;
yet
the
mute
intensity
of
her
face
had
sunk
into
his
heart
.
"
She
has
been
terribly
wronged
,
"
he
repeated
to
himself
,
as
he
left
the
prison
.
"
God
help
her
!
she
is
very
to
be
so
calm
.
"
young
When
Mr.
Wyville
emerged
from
the
prison
arch
,
he
walked
rapidly
along
the
river
towards
Westminster
.
He
was
in
deep
thought
.
He
proceeded
a
little
distance
,
then
stopped
,
and
looked
down
on
the
turbid
stream
,
as
if
undecided
.
This
was
unlike
the
usual
calm
deliberateness
of
his
conduct
.
He
was
evidently
perplexed
and
troubled
.
After
pausing
a
while
,
he
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
then
retraced
his
steps
,
passed
Millbank
,
and
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
Chelsea
.
It
was
an
old
habit
of
his
to
solve
difficult
questions
as
he
walked
;
and
he
selected
a
quiet
suburb
,
with
streets
leading
into
the
country
roads
.
In
the
streets
,
there
was
nothing
very
noticeable
about
the
man
,
except
his
athletic
stride
and
deeply
bronzed
face
.
He
might
be
classed
by
the
passing
observer
as
a
naval
officer
who
had
served
in
southern
many
years
latitudes
,
or
as
a
.
inner
man
who
interests
us
:
let
us
follow
the
burden
of
his
thought
.
a
foreign
captain
.
His
dress
had
something
of
the
sailor
about
its
style
and
cloth
.
But
it
is
the
Remorse
does
not
end
in
this
calmness
,
unless
the
prisoner
be
insane
.
Her
mind
is
clear
,
she
is
not
melancholy
;
she
is
self
-
possessed
and
firm
.
Her
health
has
not
suffered
.
Yet
,
she
has
abandoned
belief
i
man's
truth
and
God's
mercy
.
She
does
not
claim
that
she
is
innocent
;
she
makes
no
she
accepts
her
punishment
without
a
complaint
.
These
are
not
the
symptoms
of
in
defense
and
no
charge
,
remorse
or
guilt
.
She
has
respects
abandoned
prayer
.
;
she
deliberately
shuts
out
the
past
and
the
future
.
Yet
she
is
in
all
other
obedient
,
industrious
,
and
kind
.
There
is
only
one
explanation
of
these
contradictions
--
she
is
innocent
,
and
she
has
suffered
terrible
wrong
Mr.
Wyville
did
not
return
to
his
house
till
late
in
the
evening
.
He
had
walked
for
hours
;
and
,
as
he
went
,
he
had
unravelled
,
with
infinite
patience
,
the
psychological
net
-
work
that
had
troubled
him
.
He
had
come
to
a
decision
.
Two
days
after
his
visit
to
the
prison
,
Alice
Walmsley
sat
in
her
cell
,
sewing
tirelessly
.
The
morning
had
opened
like
all
the
other
mornings
of
her
imprisonment
;
there
was
nothing
new
,
nothing
to
suggest
a
new
train
of
thought
.
Someone
who
walked
along
the
corridor
about
ten
o'clock
had
seemed
to
hesitate
a
moment
at
her
cell
,
and
then
had
passed
on
.
The
governor
,
she
thought
,
who
had
glanced
through
the
watch
-
grate
.
In
the
wall
of
every
.
cell
there
was
a
minute
hole
,
about
two
inches
square
on
the
exterior
,
cut
in
the
solid
stone
.
The
opening
,
which
grew
wide
towards
the
interior
of
the
cell
,
was
in
the
shape
of
a
wedge
.
A
warder
outside
could
see
a
large
part
of
the
cell
,
while
the
prisoner
could
only
.
see
the
eye
of
the
warder
.
As
the
