mutinous
deputy
,
had
plucked
the
conspicuous
cap
from
his
head
,
rent
off
its
broad
gold
band
,
flung
it
on
the
earth
,
and
put
his
foot
on
it
.
The
next
instant
his
hand
had
torn
the
insignia
of
rank
from
his
collar
,
unbuckled
his
belt
,
and
thrown
his
sword
on
the
ground
.
Then
,
with
a
voice
that
like
a
trumpet
through
the
prison
yard
,
he
called
to
the
military
officer
for
a
file
of
men
,
with
irons
.
rang
The
leader
of
the
warders
had
never
moved
--
but
he
had
grown
pale
.
He
had
expected
a
parley
,
at
least
,
perhaps
,
a
surrender
of
the
Comptroller's
plan
.
But
he
was
dealing
with
one
who
was
more
than
a
man
,
who
was
at
that
moment
an
embodied
principle
.
In
a
few
moments
the
degraded
and
dumbfounded
deputy
was
in
irons
,
with
a
soldier
at
each
shoulder
.
"
Take
him
to
the
cells
!
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
His
stern
order
reached
every
ear
in
the
yard
.
Then
he
addressed
the
military
commander
.
"
Limber
up
those
guns
,
and
march
your
riflemen
to
their
quarters
!
"
In
two
minutes
there
was
not
a
soldier
nor
a
gun
in
sight
.
"
The
warders
will
bring
their
prisoners
into
square
,
to
listen
to
the
first
half
-
yearly
report
of
the
Penal
Law
.
"
Rapidly
and
silently
,
with
faces
of
uncertainty
,
the
movement
was
performed
,
and
the
thousand
convicts
stood
in
solid
mass
before
the
austere
Comptroller
-
General
,
who
had
mounted
his
horse
,
and
looked
down
on
them
,
holding
in
his
hand
the
report
.
was
a
profound
silence
.
There
Mr.
Wyville
read
from
the
paper
,
in
a
rapid
but
clear
voice
,
the
names
of
twelve
men
,
and
ordered
them
to
step
to
the
front
,
if
present
.
Seven
men
walked
from
the
convict
square
,
and
stood
before
him
,
the
other
five
were
on
the
road
-
parties
throughout
the
colony
.
Mr.
Wyville
addressed
the
seven
.
"
Men
,
by
your
good
conduct
as
recorded
under
the
old
law
and
your
attention
to
the
rules
of
the
present
penal
code
,
you
have
become
entitled
to
a
remission
of
the
unexpired
term
of
your
sentences
.
To
-
day's
misconduct
shall
not
stop
your
reward
.
You
are
.
e
free
.
Guard
,
allow
those
men
to
pass
through
the
gate
!
"
The
seven
men
,
wide
-
eyed
,
unable
to
realize
the
news
,
almost
tottered
towards
the
barrier
.
The
eyes
of
their
fellow's
in
the
square
followed
them
in
a
daze
till
they
disappeared
through
the
outer
gate
.
There
was
a
sound
from
the
square
,
like
a
deep
breath
,
followed
by
a
slight
shuffling
of
feet
.
Then
again
there
was
absolute
stillness
,
every
eye
intently
fixed
on
the
face
of
the
Comptroller
-
General
.
Again
he
read
a
list
of
men
came
names
,
and
a
number
of
quickly
to
the
front
,
and
stood
in
line
.
The
new
law
had
awarded
to
these
a
certain
considerable
remission
,
which
sounded
to
their
ears
like
the
very
promise
of
freedom
.
Still
the
lists
were
read
,
and
still
the
remissions
were
conferred
.
When
the
report
was
ended
,
seven
men
had
been
released
,
and
sixty
-
seven
out
of
the
thousand
present
,
all
of
whom
had
that
morning
threatened
mutiny
,
had
received
rewards
striking
away
years
of
their
punishment
.
"
"
Men
!
we
have
heard
the
last
sound
of
mutiny
in
the
colony
.
"
Mr.
Wyville's
voice
thrilled
the
convicts
like
deep
-
sounded
music
:
they
looked
at
him
with
awe
-
struck
faces
.
Every
heart
was
filled
with
the
conviction
that
he
was
their
friend
that
it
was
well
to
listen
to
him
and
obey
him
.
"
From
this
day
every
man
is
earning
his
freedom
,
and
an
interest
in
this
colony
.
Your
rights
,
are
written
down
,
This
lan
trusts
to
and
you
your
I
shall
know
them
.
You
must
regard
the
rights
of
others
.
shall
be
regarded
as
yours
man
be
heedful
that
is
not
disgraced
nor
every
manhood
,
and
offers
you
a
reward
for
your
labour
;
let
weakened
by
unmanly
conduct
.
See
to
it
,
each
for
himself
,
that
you
return
as
speedily
as
you
may
to
the
freedom
and
independence
which
this
colony
offers
you
.
"
Turning
to
the
warders
,
he
gave
a
brief
order
to
march
the
men
to
their
work
;
and
,
turning
his
horse
,
rode
slowly
from
the
prison
.
From
that
hour
,
as
sometimes
a
tempest
dies
after
.
one
tremendous
blast
,
the
uproar
against
the
new
law
was
silent
.
As
swiftly
as
couriers
could
the
new's
,
the
scene
in
the
prison
yard
was
described
to
every
road
carry
party
in
the
colony
Among
the
warders
opposition
disappeared
the
moment
the
gold
band
of
the
deputy's
cap
was
seen
under
the
Comptroller's
foot
.
Among
the
convicts
,
disorder
hid
its
wild
head
as
soon
as
t
they
realized
that
the
blind
system
of
work
without
reward
had
been
replaced
by
y
one
that
made
every
day
count
for
a
hope
not
only
of
liberty
,
but
independence
.
In
a
word
,
from
that
day
the
colony
ceased
to
be
stagnant
,
and
began
to
progress
