It
was
Harriet
Draper
who
supplicated
the
nun
,
and
who
had
besought
her
for
days
with
the
same
ceaseless
счус
·
Sister
Cecilia
would
gladly
have
allowed
her
to
work
for
the
sick
,
but
she
feared
that
Alice
would
see
her
.
She
had
been
compelled
for
days
to
refuse
the
heartrending
petition
.
"
You
shall
have
your
wish
,
"
said
the
nun
this
day
,
with
a
kind
look
at
Harriet
,
"
but
not
in
the
hospital
.
"
"
Anywhere
,
anywhere
!
"
cried
Harriet
,
rising
with
a
wistful
face
;
"
only
let
me
tend
someone
who
is
sick
.
I
want
to
do
some
good
.
"
"
Harriet
,
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
,
"
you
have
told
me
your
unhappy
story
and
I
,
Woman
!
"
"
I
do
--
God
knows
I
do
!
"
interrupted
the
unfortunate
one
.
am
sure
you
wish
to
be
a
good
"
As
you
hope
to
be
forgiven
,
you
must
forgive
--
you
must
forgive
even
your
!
husband
.
"
Poor
Harriet
covered
her
face
in
her
hands
,
and
made
no
answer
,
only
moved
her
head
from
side
to
side
,
as
in
pain
.
"
Harriet
,
if
your
husband
were
on
board
this
ship
,
sick
and
dying
of
the
fever
,
would
you
not
tend
him
and
forgive
him
before
he
died
?
"
Wild
-
eyed
,
the
woman
stared
at
Sister
Cecilia
,
as
"
He
is
on
board
--
he
is
dying
of
the
fever-
-
willy
if
she
had
not
understood
the
I
you
not
take
care
question
.
of
him
?
"
if
"
Oh
--
ah
!
"
wailed
Harriet
,
in
a
long
cry
,
sinking
on
her
knees
and
clasping
Sister
Cecilia's
dress
.
"
He
would
drive
me
-away
--
he
would
not
let
me
.
stay
there
--
he
does
not
love
me
!
"
"
But
love
him-
you
-you
i
will
tend
him
,
and
you
will
forgive
him
.
Will
y
you
not
?
"
Yes
,
I
will
--
I
will
wait
on
him
day
and
night
,
and
he
shall
recover
with
my
nursing
.
"
She
dried
her
weeping
eyes
,
to
show
the
Sister
her
immediate
readiness
and
calmness
.
"
Take
me
to
him
,
"
she
said
,
with
only
quivering
lips
;
"
let
me
begin
now
.
"
"
Come
,
then
"
said
Sister
Cecilia
;
and
she
led
Harriet
Draper
to
the
hatch
,
and
aft
to
the
captain's
quarters
.
Mr.
Wyville
rose
as
Sister
Cecilia
entered
,
followed
by
Harriet
.
As
he
did
so
,
the
sick
man
moved
,
and
muttered
something
,
with
upraised
feeble
arm
.
With
a
low
sob
or
cry
,
Harriet
darted
past
Sister
Cecilia
,
and
sank
beside
the
bed
.
She
took
the
upraised
arm
and
drew
it
to
her
breast
,
and
covered
the
feverish
hand
with
tearful
kisses
.
At
the
touch
,
the
sick
man
ceased
to
wander
,
and
turning
his
head
,
seemed
to
fall
at
once
into
a
peaceful
sleep
.
Harriet
,
seeing
this
,
after
her
first
emotion
,
turned
to
Mr.
Wyville
and
Sister
Cecilia
with
a
smile
of
Joy
,
and
,
still
holding
,
her
husband's
arm
to
her
breast
,
pointed
to
his
restful
sleep
.
They
smiled
at
her
in
return
,
though
their
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
.
Sister
Cecilia
instructed
her
as
to
the
attendance
,
and
then
withdrew
,
leaving
the
guilty
and
unconscious
husband
in
his
wife's
s
care
.
There
was
joy
at
least
in
one
heart
on
board
that
night
.
From
her
low
seat
beside
the
bed
,
Harriet
Draper
watched
his
face
,
murmuring
soft
and
endearing
words
,
and
obeying
the
doctor's
instructions
to
the
letter
and
second
.
"
He
will
recover
,
and
he
will
know
me
,
"
she
whispered
to
her
heart
;
"
I
shall
win
back
his
love
by
--
being
faithful
and
forgiving
"
The
climax
of
the
fever
would
not
come
till
the
sixth
day
and
during
these
days
Harriet
watched
her
husband
with
scarcely
an
hour's
rest
.
Every
hour
that
passed
added
to
his
chance
of
recovery
,
swiftly
towards
the
cooler
latitudes
.
as
the
ship
was
sailing
One
day
,
while
Harriet
sat
beside
the
bed
,
holding
the
feeble
hand
,
as
she
loved
to
do
,
there
came
a
lucid
interval
to
her
husband
.
She
had
been
murmuring
soft
words
as
she
kissed
his
hand
,
when
,
looking
at
his
face
,
she
met
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
.
For
a
moment
there
came
a
l
but
before
she
could
speak
his
name
,
or
recall
his
memory
light
of
recognition
and
dismay
in
his
look
;
the
light
faded
,
and
he
reverted
to
a
state
of
sluggish
delirium
.
For
the
first
time
since
she
came
to
his
side
,
a
chill
of
fear
pierced
Harriet's
heart
.
For
one
instant
she
knew
he
had
seen
her
.
But
there
was
no
love
in
the
look
of
recognition
.
What
if
the
same
cold
stare
should
return
on
his
recovery
,
and
continue
?
"
God
will
not
let
it
be
"
whispered
her
heart
.
"
When
he
recovers
,
he
will
surely
love
me
as
of
old
!
"
WOMAN'S
LOVE
AND
HATRED
.
On
the
later
days
of
Captain
Draper's
illness
he
moaned
and
tumbled
restlessly
.
One
of
the
worst
symptoms
of
the
fever
was
its
persistent
hold
on
the
brain
.
The
sick
man
raved
constantly
,
carried
on
excited
conversations
,
gave
orders
to
the
sailors
,
and
,
in
the
midst
of
these
wanderings
,
again
and
again
reverted
to
one
dark
subject
that
seemed
to
haunt
his
inflamed
mind
.
He
lived
over
and
over
again
,
day
after
day
,
terrible
scenes
,
that
had
surely
been
rehearsed
in
his
mind
before
