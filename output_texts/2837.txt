Well
,
he
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
'
penal
servitude
,
and
was
transported
to
West
Australia
.
After
serving
some
years
came
in
,
and
he
was
hired
out
to
a
settler
,
a
respectable
man
,
there

the

again

ex

convict
.
Some
time
afterwards
,
the
violent
Chartist
attempted
to
murder
his
employer
,
and
then
escaped
into
the
bush
.
He
was
captured
,
but
escaped
again
,
and
was
again
.
re-
-captured
by
the
very
man
he
had
tried
to
murder

Mark
the
dreadful
ending
,
gentlemen
,
to
this
series
of
mistaken
lenities
to
a
criminal
.
On
their
way
to
the
prison
,
the
absconder
broke
his
manacles
,
seized
a
pistol
from
a
native
policeman
,
murdered
his
brave
captor
,
and
escaped
again
to
the
bush
.
"
"
God
bless
me
!
what
a
shocking
story
!
"
said
one
.
"
Was
the
fellow
captured
again
?
"
asked
one
of
the
Committee
.
of
the
lawyers
.
"
No
,
"
said
Sir
Joshua
;
"
he
escaped
to
the
swamps
.
But
there
is
a
rumour
among
the
convicts
that
he
is
still
alive
.
Is
there
not
,
Mr.
Haggett
?
"
Mr.
Haggett
bent
his
head
in
assent
.
Then
he
rubbed
his
forehead
and
eyes
,
as
if
relieved
of
o
a
strain
.
He
had
been
watching
the
face
of
Mr.
Wyville
with
painful
eagerness
.
as
Sir
Joshua
spoke
;
but
in
that
impassive
visage
no
line
of
meaning
to
Haggett's
.
could
be
traced
.
eyes
Sir
Joshua
sat
down
,
confident
that
he
could
depend
on
the
Committee
for
a
report
in
his
favour
.
"
Is
there
actual
evidence
that
this
convict
of
whom
you
spoke
murdered
his
captor
?
"
Mr.
Wyville
addressed
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
,
standing
at
the
end
of
the
long
green
table
.
There
was
nothing
in
the
words
,
but
every
one
in
the
room
felt
a
thrill
at
the
deep
sound
of
the
resonant
voice
.
The
Committee
,
who
had
not
looked
at
Mr.
Wyville
before
,
stared
at
him
now
in
undisguised
surprise
.
He
was
strangely
powerful
as
he
stood
there
alone
,
looking
calmly
at
Sir
Joshua
for
an
answer
.
"
Evidence
?
Certainly
,
there
is
evidence
.
The
brave
settler
who
captured
the
malefactor
disappeared
;
and
the
bushman
from
whom
the
convict
seized
the
pistol
saw
him
point
it
at
the
head
of
his
captor
.
Is
not
that
evidence
enough
?
"
"
Not
for
a
court
of
justice
,
"
quietly
answered
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Sir
,
"
said
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
,
superciliously
,
"
it
may
not
appeal
to
sentimental
judgments
;
but
it
carries
conviction
to
reasonable
minds
.
"
"
It
should
not
--
for
it
is
not
true
!
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
his
tone
somewhat
deepened
with
earnestness
.
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
started
angrily
to
his
feet
.
He
glared
at
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Do
you
"
Yes
!
"
i
know
it
to
be
false
?
"
he
sternly
asked
.
"
How
do
you
know
?
"
"
I
,
myself
,
saw
the
death
of
this
man
that
t
you
say
was
murdered
.
'
"
You
You
saw
his
death
!
"
said
in
one
breath
Sir
Joshua
and
the
Committee
.
"
Yes
.
He
accepted
a
bribe
from
the
man
he
had
captured
,
and
released
him
.
I
saw
this
settler
afterwards
die
of
thirst
on
the
plains
--
I

him
by
accident
--
he
died
before
my
eyes
,
alone
-
-
and
he
was
not
murdered
.
'
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
sat
down
,
and
twisted
nervously
on
his
seat
.
Mr.
Haggett
looked
frightened
,
as
if
he

upon

slip
of

subject

He

Joshua

who
read
,
and
then
turned
to
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
What
was
the
name
of
the
man
you
saw
die
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Isaac
Bowman
,
"
answered
Mr.
Wyville
.
Both
Sir
Joshua
and
Mr.
Haggett
settled
down
in
their
seats
,
having
no
more
to
say
or
suggest
.
"
"
You
have
lived
a
long
time
in
West
Australia
,
Mr.
Wyville
?
"
asked
one
of
the
lawyers
of
the
Committee
,
after
a
surprised
pause
.
"
Many
years
.
"
"
You
are
the
owner
of
property
in
the
colony
?
"
"
Yes
.
"
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
pricked
up
his
ears
,
and
turned
sharply
on
his
chair
,
with
an
insolent
stare
.
"
Where
does
your
property
lie
?
"
he
asked
.
"
In
the
Vasse
district
,
"
answered
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Here
is
a
map
of
West
Australia
,
"
said
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
,
with
an
overbearing
air
,
"
will
y
I
you
be
kind
enough
to
point
out
to
the
Committee
the
location
of
your
possessions
?
"
There
was
obviously
so
malevolent
a
meaning
in
Sir
Joshua
Hobb's
request
,
that
the
whole
Committee
and
the
gentlemen
present
stood
up
to
watch
the
map
,
expecting
Mr.
Wyville
to
approach
.
But
he
did
not
move
.
"
My
boundaries
are
easily
traced
,
"
he
said
,
from
his
place
at
the
end
of
the
table
;
"
the
northern
and
southern
