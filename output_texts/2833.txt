Yes
,
Sir
,
they
ought
to
be
separated

This
Wyville
takes
a
great
interest

Number
Four

It
was

that
sent
the
nun
to
her

Certainly

Mr.
Haggett
departed
,
and
as
he
walked
down
Parliament
street
,
glancing
furtively
around
to
see
that
he
was
unobserved
,
he
smiled
to
the
uttermost
reef

FEMALE
TRANSPORTS
.
THE
morning
arrived
for
the
convict
ship
to
sail
,
and
the
last
chains
of
male
prisoners
were
mustered
in
the
prison
yard
of
Millbank
,
ready
to
be
marched
to
the
train
,
for
embarkation
on
the
convict
ship
at
Portland
.
In
one
of
the
Pentagonal
yards
stood
the
female
prisoners
,
fifty
in
number
.
They
whispered
covertly
to
each
other
,
enjoying
for
the
first
time
for
years
the
words
that
were
not
orders
,
and
the
faces
that
were
not
cold
.
"
What
is
your
name
?
"
How
long
have
you
served
?
"
"
What
nice
hair
have
!
"
you
"
Will
they
cut
off
f
our
hair
again
in
Australia
?
"
"
Were

lagged
before
?
"
"
That
one
there
,
with
the
red
mark
on
her
cheek
,
was
sentenced
to
be
hung
.
"
"
This
is
my
second
time
.
"
These
were
the
words
that
might
be
heard
in
the
ranks
-
-short
sentences
,
full
of
direct
meaning
,
such
as
are
always
spoken
when
formality
is
absent
,
and
curiosity
is
excited
.
The
male
chains
having
been
inspected
by
the
governor
,
who
was
accompanied
by
Mr.
Wyville
,
had
marched
from
the
prison
to
the
railway
station
.
Four
great
waggons
.
or
tumbrils
rolled
into
the
yard
,
to
carry
away
the
female
convicts
.
Before
they
entered
the
waggons
,
the
governor
addressed
the
women
,
telling
them
that
their
good
conduct
in
prison
had
earned
this
change
;
that
their
life
in
the
new
country
to
which
they
were
going
would
be
one
o
of
opportunity
;
that
their
past
was
all
behind
them
,
and
a
fair
field
before
them
to
work
out
honest
and
happy
lives
.
Many
of
the
prisoners
sobbed
bitterly
as
the
kind
governor
spoke
.
Hope
,
indeed
,
was
bright
before
them
;
but
they
were
parting
from
all
that
they
had
ever
loved
;
they
would
never
more
see
the
face
of
father
or
mother
,
brother
or
sister
;
they
would
never
more
see
an
shattered
and
shameful
;
but
the
moment
of
parting
from
every
association
of
youth
was
the
more
embittered
,
perhaps
,
by
the
thought
of
their
unworthiness
.

Their
lives

When
the
governor
had
spoken
,
they
entered
the
tumbrils
,
and
the
guards
fell
in
.
The
old
governor
raised
his
hat
.
He
was
deeply
affected
at
the
scene
,
common
though
it
must
have
been
to
him
.
"
Good
-
bye
,
and
God
bless
,
you
all
in
your
new
life
!
"
he
said
.
The
driver
of
the
front
tumbril
looked
round
,
to
see
that
all
was
ready
before
starting
his
horses
.
"
Wait
,
"
said
a
tall
man
,
who
was
rapidly
and
eagerly
scanning
the
faces
of
the
women
,
as
he
passed
from
Waggon
to
waggon
;
"
there's
a
mistake
here
.
"
"
"
What
is
the
matter
there
?
"
shouted
the
governor
.
"
There
is
one
prisoner
absent
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
tall
man
,
who
was
Mr.
Haggett
;
"
one
prisoner
absent
who
was
ordered
for
this
ship
.
"
"
What
prisoner
?
"
asked
the
governor
"
Number
Four
.
"
"
"
Start
up
your
horses
,
"
shouted
the
governor
;
and
the
first
tumbril
lumbered
out
of
the
yard
.
The
governor
was
looking
at
Mr.
Haggett
,
who
stood
beside
the
last
waggon
,
his
face
a
study
of
rage
disappointment
.
and
"
That
prisoner
was
specially
ordered
for
this
ship
,
"
he
repeated
.
"
Sir
Joshua
Hobb
wrote
the
order
with
his
own
hand
.
"
"
He
has
countermanded
it
,
"
said
the
governor
,
curtly
.
"
When
?
"
asked
Haggett
.
"
"
Two
hours
ago
,
"
said
the
governor
.
"
The
prisoner
will
remain
in
Millbank
.
"
Mr.
Haggett
looked
his
baffled
malevolence
at
the
governor
,
who
paid
no
heed
to
the
glance
.
Mr.
Wyville
stood
close
to
him
,
but
Haggett
never
met
his
eye
during
the
scene
.
As
he
departed
,
however
,
in
passing
him
,
he
raised
his
eyes
for
an
instant
to
Mr.
Wyville's
face
and
said-
-
"
I
am
going
to
West
Australia
.
I
shall
soon
return
.
