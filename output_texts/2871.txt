"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
D
Traper
,
standing
an
the
road
;
"
is
that
a
threat
?
"
drinking
wine
stolen
from
the
Houguemont
,
and
sold
to

I
mean
that
those
men
in
the
tavern
are

charge
of
it

"
Draper's
dry
lips
person
came
together
and
opened
again
several
times
,
but
he
did
not
speak
.
He
was
suffering
agonies
in
this
series
of
defeats
and
exposures
.
He
shuddered
again
at
the
terrible
thought
that
some
unseen
and
powerful
hand
was
playing
against
him
.
"
Mr.
--Reader
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
holding
out
his
hand
with
a
smile
,
"
have
I
offended
you
or
injured
you
?
"
Haggett
looked
at
the
proffered
hand
until
it
fell
back
to
Draper's
side
.
"
Yes
,
"
he
answered
,
"
a
person
like
you
offends
and
injures
all
decent
people
.
"
Without
a
pretence
of
resentment
,
the
crestfallen
Draper
retraced
his
steps
towards
the
tavern
.
Mr.
Haggett
stood
and
watched
him
.
On
his
way
,
Draper
resolved
to
leave
Fremantle
that
evening
,
and
ride
to
Perth
,
where
he
would
live
much
more
quietly
than
he
had
done
here
.
He
saw
the
mistake
he
had
made
,
and
he
would
not
repeat
it
.
He
quietly
asked
the
landlord
for
his
bill
,
and
gave
directions
for
his
trunks
to
be
forwarded
next
day
.
He
asked
if
he
could
have
a
horse
that
night
.
"
Certainly
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
an
ex
-
convict
himself
;
"
but
you
must
show
me
your
pass
.
"
"
What
pass
?
I
'
t
you
are
,
"
said
the
landlord
;
"
only
I'm
not
allowed
to
let
horses
to
"
ma
free
.
man
.
"
Oh
,
I
'
strangers
without
seeing
their
passes
.
"
'
m
not
supposed
to
know
what
"
Who
grants
these
passes
?
"
"
The
Comptroller
-
General
,
and
he
is
at
Perth
.
But
he'll
be
here
in
a
day
.
Draper
cursed
between
his
teeth
as
he
turned
away
.
or
two
"
A
short
man
,
in
a
blue
coat
with
brass
buttons
,
who
had
heard
this
conversation
,
addressed
him
as
he
passed
the
bar
.
"
There
ain't
no
fear
of
your
getting
lost
,
Captain
Draper
.
They
take
better
care
in

Dale

"
of
a
a
man
here
than
we
used
to
Draper
stared
at
the
speaker
as
if
he
saw
an
apparition
.
There
,
before
him
,
with
a
smile
that
had
no
kindness
for
him
,
was
Officer
Lodge
,
who
had
known
him
since
boyhood
.
His
amazement
was
complete
;
he
had
not
seen
Ben
Lodge
on
the
Voyage
,
;
the
latter
having
quietly
avoided
his
eye
"
Why
,
old
friend
,
"
he
said
,
holding
out
his
hand
with
a
joyful
lower
face
,
"
what
brings
you
here
?
"
Instead
of
taking
his
hand
,
Ben
Lodge
took
his
"
glass
a
'
hale
"
from
the
counter
,
and
looked
steadily
at
Draper
.
"
That's
the
foulest
hand
that
ever
belonged
to
Walton
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
Draper
was
about
to
pass
on
,
with
a
"
pshaw
,
"
when
Ben
Lodge
stopped
him
with
a
word
.
"
Maybe
you
wouldn't
want
to
go
to
Perth
if
you
knew
who
was
there
.
"
you
want
to
see
her
?
"
"
Who
is
there
?
"
"
Alice
Walmsley
--
free
and
happy
,
thank
Heaven
!
Do
Draper
stepped
close
to
the
old
man
with
a
deadly
scowl
.
"
Be
careful
,
"
he
hissed
,
stealing
his
hand
toward
Ben's
throat
,
"
or
-
-
"
A
long
black
hand
seized
Draper's
fingers
as
they
moved
in
their
stealthy
threat
,
and
twisted
them
almost
from
the
sockets
;
and
,
standing
at
his
shoulder
,
Draper
found
a
naked
bushman
,
holding
It
was
a
spear

Ngarra

jil
,
whom
he
did
not
recognize
in
his
native
costume
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
at
first
,
too
,
had
greatly
shocked
and
disappointed
Officer
Lodge
and
Mr.
Haggett
.
"
There's
someone
else
from
Walton
will
be
in
Perth
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
continued
Ben
Lodge
,
with
a
smile
at
!
Draper's
discomfiture
;
"
and
,
let
me
tell
you
beforehand
,
Samuel
Draper
,
if
he
lays
eyes
on
you
in
that
'
ere
town

you'll
be
sorry
you
didn't
die
of

Without
a
look
to
either
side
Draper
strade
from
the
tavern
,
and
walked
towards
a
hill
within
the
town
,
which
he
climbed
-grass
.
He
was
shaken
to
the
place
where
his
soul
He
sat
down
on
the
summit
,
amid
the
rough
and
dry
salt-
might
have
been
.
He
felt
that
he
could
not
move
tongue
1
nor
hand
without
discovery
.
The
cunning
that
had
become
almost
intellectual
from
long
,
use
was
worthless
as
chaff
.
His
life
recoiled
on
him
like
a
hissing
snake
,
and
bit
him
horribly
.
Before
his
death
,
he
was
being
judged
and
put
in
hell
.
He
sat
hidden
in
the
salt
-
grass
among
come
out
in
beautiful
clearness
;
but
he
did
not
see
them
.
He
only
saw
the
flame
of
the
sins
that
had
found
him
out
,
as
they
burned
in
their
places
along
his
baleful
career
.
When
the
sea
-
wind
came
in
,
damp
and
heavy
,
and
remaining
the
vermin
of
the
hill
,
until
the
night
had
long
fallen
.
The
stars
had
made
him
cough
,
for
his
chest
was
weak
,
he
rose
and
crept
down
towards
the
tavern
,
to
spend
t
the
