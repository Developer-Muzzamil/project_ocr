it

I
resumed

took

attention

entered
into

I
remember
being

by

for
the

and

remarks

made

The
time
passed
on
,
until
at
a

minutes
past
eleven
I
made
preparations
for
leaving

As

I
replied
.
We
walked
away
together
.
When
we
reached
upper
Sleeke
Street
,
we
took
up
our
post
observation
in
the
deep
doorway
of
an
old
-
fashioned
house
nearly
over
against
mine
.
We
waited
.
In
about
half
an
hour
-an
age
to
me
!
-
-I
saw
all
the
lights
in
my
house
extinguished
,
save
in
my
wife's
sitting
-
room
.
Soon
afterwards
the
hall
-
door
slowly
opened
,
and
Eva
herself
with
a
cloak
over
her
head
came
out
,
traversed
a
bit
of
a
a
garden
which
some
of
the
houses
had
in
those
days
before
them
,
opened
the
iron
gate
and
walked
slowly
down
the
street
.
Every
now
and
then
she
cast
anxious
glances
behind
.
When
I
saw
her
all
my
calmness
deserted
men
and
I
strove
to
break
loose
from
Braithwaite's
restraining
arm
,
and
accost
and
upbraid
her
.
But
though
all
the
infernal
passions
blazed
within
me
,
and
I
could
not
move
.
Cecil's
grasp
was
like
a
vice
on
my
arm
,
to
"
In
a
moment
or
two
she
was
joined
by
a
tall
man
,
muffled
up
,
and
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
.
After
talking
earnestly
for
a
few
moments
,
they
entered
the
house
together
.
At
this
sight
my
calmness
returned
,
and
with
it
my
presence
of
mind
.
I
remembered
having
heard
something
of
a
former
lover
of
Eva's
who
had
gone
t
India
,
and
doubted
not
that
this
was
the
man
.
Like
a
flash
there
came
to
my
mind
,
too
,
the
interest
with
which
she
had
questioned
Colonel
Davenport
a
a
friend
of
-about
Indian
military
affairs
,
and
this
confirmed
my
idea
.
At
that
moment
I
rejoiced
that
&
va
was
yet
my
wife
in
name
only
.
On
the
very
next
day
I
had
made
arrangements
for

I
stepped
cautiously
,
j
across
the
road
,
followed
by
Cecil
,
and
while
wondering
how
we
should
gain
access
to
the
house
,
saw
that
the
front
door
latch
had
not
caught
,
and
it
stood
ajar
.
We
both
entered
noiselessly
,
and
in
a
few
moments
I
stood
on
the
landing
on
which
were
my
wife's

I
looked
into
the
other
room

A
tall
,
fair
to
the
fire
,
and
now
that
his
muffler
and
hat
were
removed
,
I
could
see
that
he
was
very
handsome
,
though
poorly
enough
dressed
.
I
did
not
dare
to
dwell
looking
at
him
for
a
second
,
but
turned
again
to
my
wife's
room
.
She
was
half
-
way
.
across
when
I
entered
it
,
with
a
bundle
of
notes
in
her
hand
.
Never
shall
I
forget
the
start
and
look
of
horrified
surprise
she
gave
when
she
encountered
this
tiger
in
her
path
.
The
notes
dropped
from
her
hand
,
and
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
,
but
something
in
my
face
froze
her
words
,
and
though
they
moved
,
no
sound
did
issue
.
She
simply
stood
gazing
at
me
with
horror
.
"
You
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
offer
any
explanation
,
'
I
said
.
'
I
know
all
.
'
She
watched
me
without
speaking
,
while
I
took
the
key
from
the
inside
of
the
lack
ere
leaving
with
it
in
my
hand
.
Then
she
staggered
towards
me
,
and
flung
her
arms
around
my
neck
sobbing
,
'
Forgive
me
,
Harold
!
Would
to
God
I
had
never
deceived
you
!
"
Goaded
with
I
hurled
her
from
me
,
and
she
sank
on
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint

I

The
Braithwaite
at
my
side
,
entered
the
sitting

r
man
,
aroused
by
the
sound
of
my
wife's
fall
,
and
our
footsteps
,
was
on
his
feet
when
we
entered
.
My
calmness
all
fled
,
I
rushed
towards
him
,
and
with
an
oath
,
closed
with
him
,
commencing
a
desperate
struggle
.
He
was
a
strong
y
man
,
so
was
I
,
and
although
he
was
the
one
taller
,

my
frenzy
lent
me
unwanted
strength
which
made
me
fully
his
equal
.
All
round
the
room
we
flung
.
another
about
in
what
seemed
a
death
-
grapple
.
Methought
he
would
have
mastered
me
,
yet
I
would
have
succumbed
rather
than
have
Cecil's
impending
aid
.
Luckily
,
as
we
passed
one
corner
,
I
snatched
at
a
heavily
-
loaded
riding
-
whip
,
and
,
securing
it
,
dealt
him
a
terrible
blow
on
the
temple
.
Down
he
went
,
without
a
groan
.
Quivering
with
and
excitement
,
I
stood
,
grasping
the
whip
by
the
butt
-
end
,
waiting
for
him
to
rise
.
But
he
lay
quite
still
.
Presently
Braithwaite
,
with
a
look
of
apprehension
,
strode
to
his
side
and
bent
over
him
.
When
he
looked
up
,
his
face
was
blanched
with
terror
,
and
his
voice
sounded
harsh
and
unnatural
.
"
You
have
killed
him
,
'
he
faltered
,
rising
.
At
that
moment
I
was
a
murderer
in
spirit
,
if
not
in
deed
,
for
I
was
glad
when
I
