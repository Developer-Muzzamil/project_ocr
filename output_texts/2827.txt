watching
his
master
with
a
keen
and
constant
look
.
Mr.
Wyville
,
sitting
beside
the
window
,
seemed
to
observe
the
richly
cultivated
fields
and
picturesque
villages
through
which
the
mail
train
flew
without
pausing
;
but
,
in
truth
,
he
neither
saw
nor
&
thought
of
outward
things
.
There
is
a
power
in
some
minds
of
utterly
shutting
out
externals
-
-
of
withdrawing
,
the
common
functions
from
the
organs
of
s
f
sense
to
assist
the
concentration
of
the
introverted
mind
.
At
such
a
time
the
open
eye
is
blind-
-
it
has
become
a
mere
lens
,
reflecting
but
not
perceiving
;
the
tympanum
of
the
ear
vibrates
to
the
outward
wave
,
but
has
ceased
to
translate
its
message
to
the
brain
.
The
soul
within
has
separated
itself
from
the
moving
world
,
and
has
retired
to
its
cell
like
an
anchorite
,
taking
with
it
some
high
subject
for
contemplation
or
some
profound
problem
for
solution
.
From
this
closet
of
the
soul
emerge
the
lightning
thoughts
that
startle
,
elevate
,
and
deify
mankind
,
sweeping
away
old
systems
like
an
overflow
of
the
ocean
.
Within
this
cell
the
Christ
-
mind
reflected
for
thirty
-
three
years
,
before
the
Word
was
uttered
.
Within
this
cell
the
soul
of
Dante
penetrated
the
harrescent
gloom
of
the
infernal
spheres
,
and
beheld
the
radiant
form
of
Beatrice
.
Within
this
cell
the
spirit
that
was
Shakespeare
bisected
the
human
heart
,
and
read
every
impulse
of
its
mysterious
network
.
Here
the
blind
Milton
forgot
the
earth
,
and
lived
an
awful
laeon
beyond
the
worlds
,
amid
the
warring
thoughts
of
God
.
Great
and
sombre
was
the
Thought
which
lay
within
the
cell
of
this
traveller's
soul
to
be
investigated
and
solved
.
Villages
,
and
fields
,
and
streams
passed
the
outward
.
that
was
,
for
the
time
,
the
window
of
a
closed
and
darkened
room
.
eye
upon
the
dissecting
table
,
before
the
solitary
midnight
student
,
so
l
lay
upon
the
table
,
As
the
pale
corpse
lies
within
this
man's
soul
,
a
living
body
for
dissection-
-
the
hideous
body
of
Crime
.
For
years
it
had
lain
there
,
and
the
brooding
soul
had
often
withdrawn
from
the
outer
world
to
contemplate
its
repulsive
and
mysterious
aspect
.
The
knife
was
in
the
hand
of
the
student
,
but
he
knew
not
where
to
begin
the
incision
.
The
hideous
thing
to
be
examined
was
inorganic
whole
,
and
yet
every
atom
of
its
intertexture
was
a
perfect
organ
.
To
his
unceasing
vision
,
the
miscreated
form
became
luminous
and
transparent
;
and
he
saw
that
,
throughout
as
a
some
unseen
and
intermittent
its
entire
being
,
beat
one
maleficent
pulsation
,
accordant
with
the
rhythm
of
some
sea
.
He
saw
that
the
parts
and
the
whole
were
one
,
yet
many-
-
-that
every
atom
had
within
itself
the
seminal
part
and
the
latent
pulse
of
the
ocean
of
Sin
For
years
he
had
looked
upon
this
fearful
body
,
wonderful
,
observant
,
speculative
.
For
years
,
when
the
contemplation
had
ceased
,
he
had
knelt
beside
the
evil
thing
and
prayed
for
light
and
knowledge
.
Day
and
night
were
as
an
outward
breath
to
the
soul
of
the
thinker
.
The
light
faded
and
the
darkness
fell
,
but
he
knew
it
not
.
His
whole
being
was
turned
within
,
and
he
would
have
groaned
with
sorrow
at
what
he
saw
,
were
it
not
for
an
adamantine
faith
in
God
,
love
,
and
justice
,
that
bridged
the
gulf
of
doubt
with
a
splendid
arch
.
It
was
midnight
when
the
train
arrived
in
Liverpool
.
The
black
man
,
Ngarra
-
jil
,
who
had
watched
so
long
and
tirelessly
the
marvellous
face
of
his
master
,
rose
from
his
corner
,
purposely
arousing
Mr.
Wyville's
attention
.
He
smiled
kindly
at
Ngarra
-
jil
,
and
spoke
to
him
in
his
own
language
,
continuing
to
do
so
as
they
were
driven
through
the
streets
to
a
hotel
.
Something
of
unusual
importance
had
brought
Mr.
Wyville
from
London
.
That
night
,
though
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
would
have
overpowered
an
ordinary
man
,
he
did
not
retire
to
rest
till
early
morning
,
and
then
he
slept
scarcely
three
hours
.
In
the
forenoon
of
that
day
,
leaving
Ngarra
-
jil
at
the
hotel
,
he
took
a
further
journeys
to
the
little
village
of
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
--
the
native
village
of
Alice
Walmsley
.
It
was
clear
that
Mr.
Wyville
had
come
to
Lancashire
on
some
purpose
connected
with
this
unhappy
girl
,
for
his
first
visit
,
having
inquired
at
the
inn
,
was
to
the
quiet
street
where
stood
her
old
home
.
He
walked
up
the
weed
-
grown
pathway
to
the
deserted
house
,
and
finding
the
outer
door
of
the
porch
unlocked
,
as
it
had
been
left
five
years
before
,
he
entered
,
and
sat
there
on
the
decaying
bench
for
a
short
time
.
Then
he
retraced
his
steps
,
and
inquired
his
way
to
the
police
station
.
The
solitary
policeman
of
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
was
just
at
that
time
occupied
in
painting
a
water
barrel
,
which
stood
on
its
donkey
-
cart
in
the
street
.
There
was
only
yone
well
of
sweet
water
in
Walton
,
the
village
lying
on
very
low
land
;
and
the
villagers
paid
each
week
a
half
-
penny
a
family
to
their
policeman
,
in
return
for
which
he
left
in
their
houses
every
day
two
large
pails
of
water
.
