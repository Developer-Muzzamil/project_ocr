At
first
,
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
end
in
failure

Its
worst
enemies
were
those

proposed
to
serve
.
The
convicts
,
as
soon
as
they
found
the
old
rigour

superintendent

at
worst
,
by
a
red
stripe
on
the
sleeve
-
-
when
first
they
saw
this
,
they
took
advantage
of
it
,
and
shamefully
abused
their
new
privileges
.
Among
the
officials
of
the
convict
service
were
,
who
always
predict
defeat
,
and
a
few
envious
and
disappointed
ones
,

At
last
,
it
came
to
such
a
condition
--
the
reports
from

districts
were
so

in

--that
even
the
warmest
friends
of
the
new
system
held
their
breath
in
fear
of
something
disastrous
.
But
through
the
gloom
,
there
was
one
.
steadfast
and
reliant
heart
and
hand
.
He
who
had
planned
the
system
had
faith
in
it
.
He
knew
what
its
foundations
were
.
When
even
the
brave
quailed
,
he
still
smiled
;
and
though
his
face
grew
thin
with
anxious
application
,
there
was
never
a
quiver
of
weakness
,
or
hesitation
in
it
.
His
near
friends
watched
him
with
tender
,
sometimes
with
terrified
interest
.
But
,
as
the
storm
thickened
,
they
spoke
to
him
less
and
less
of
the
danger
,
until
at
last
they
ceased
to
speak
at
all
.
They
only
looked
on
him
with
respect
and
love
,
and
,
did
his
few
behests
without
a
word
.
an
Mr.
Wyville
knew
that
he
was
trying
no
experiment
,
though
he
was
doing
what
had
never
been
done
before
.
It
was
not
experimental
,
because
it
was
demonstrable
.
He
had
not
based
his
system
theory
or
whim
,
but
on
the
radical
principles
of
humanity
;
and
he
was
sure
of
the
result
.
All
he
wanted
was
time
,
to
let
the
seething
settle
.
Those
who
doubted
,
were
doubting
something
as
inexorably
true
as
a
mathematical
axiom
.
His
ship
was
in
the
midst
of
a
cyclone
;
but
the
hand
on
the
tiller
was
as
true
as
the
very
compass
itself
,
for
it
obeyed
as
rigidly
a
natural
law
.
One
flash
of
passion
only
did
the
tempest
strike
from
him
.
On
the
great
parade
-
ground
of
the
prison
at
Fremantle
,
one
day
a
thousand
convicts
stood
in
line
,
charged
with
grossly
breaking
the
new
law
.
On
their
flank
was
unlimbered
a
battery
of
artillery
;
and
in
their
rear
was
a
line
of
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
and
loaded
rifles
.
Scattered
in
front
were
the
convict
officers
,
and
in
the
centre
of
the
line
,
within
hearing
of
the
convicts
,
the
malcontents
had
gathered
,
and
were
openly
denouncing
the
law
as
a
.
failure
,
and
declaring
that
the
colony
was
in
danger
.
Among
them
,
loud
in
his
dissent
,
stood
an
officer
with
a
broad
gold
band
on
his
cap-
--the
deputy
superintendent
of
the
prison
.
Mr.
Wyville
had
ridden
hard
from
Perth
,
whence
he
had
been
summoned
by
a
courier
with
a
highly
-
coloured
report
.
His
face
was
deeply
-
lined
and
careworn
,
for
he
had
scarcely
slept
an
hour
a
day
for
weeks
.
But
he
knew
that
the
turning
-
point
had
come
.
Six
months
of
the
new
system
had
passed
.
During
that
time
there
had
only
been
a
moral
restraint
on
the
convicts
-
-henceforth
,
there
would
be
a
personal
and
selfish
o
one
From
this
day
the
convicts
would
begin
to
receive
reward
for
good
conduct
,
as
well
as
reproach
for
bad
.
A
hundred
yards
behind
Mr.
Wyville
,
rode
silently
the
two
men
who
loved
him
best
--
Hamerton
and
Sheridan
.
They
had
seen
him
start
,
had
questioned
the
courier
,
and
discovered
the
cause
.
into
their
holsters
,
they
had
followed
him
in
silence
.
Thrusting
,
their
revolvers
Mr.
Wyville
checked
his
steaming
horse
as
he
drew
near
the
prison
.
He
rode
up
to
the
gate
,
and
entered
the
yard
calmly
,
but
with
such
a
bearing
,
even
imparted
to
the
horse
,
as
made
every
man
feel
that
he
was
full
of
power
.
As
he
approached
,
there
was
deep
silence
for
half
a
minute
.
Then
his
ear
caught
the
sound
of
a
a
murmur
in
the
central
group
of
officers
.
He
reined
his
horse
stiffly
,
and
regarded
them
with
flaming
eyes
.
There
was
no
sound
for
a
moment
;
then
there
was
a
whisper
;
and
then
the
deputy
with
the
gold
band
walked
to
the
front
,
and
,
without
salute
or
preface
,
spoke
:
-
-
"
The
warders
cannot
control
the
men
by
your
new
rules
.
The
colony
is
in
a
state
of
mutiny
.
"
There
ran
a
sound
,
like
a
terrible
growl
,
along
the
line
of
a
thousand
convicts
.
Mr.
Wyville
dismounted
.
His
horse
stood
unattended
.
Sheridan
and
Hamerton
closed
ups
their
hands
quietly
on
their
holster
-
pipes
.
It
was
a
moment
of
awful
responsibility
;
the
lives
of
thousands
were
in
the
balance
.
One
weak
or
false
steps
and
the
yell
of
blind
revolt
would
split
the
air
,
to
be
followed
by
the
crash
of
artillery
,
and
the
shrieks
of
a
wild
tumult
Two
revolts
stood
in
Mr.
Wyville's
presence
--
the
warders
'
,
and
the
convicts
'
.
Towards
which
side
lay
the
dangerous
step
?
There
was
no
indecision
--
not
a
moment
of
delay
in
his
action
.
With
a
few
rapid
strides
he
was
close
to
the
