"
Neither
.

I
do
not
understand
.
"
When
convicts
sail
from
England
,
they
are
assumed
to
be
at
once
in
the
penal
colony
.
As
soon
as
the
convict
ship
leaves
land
,
she
becomes
subject
to
the
penal
law
of
West
Australia
.
"
"
Who
administers
the
law
on
board
?
"
"
The
representative
of
the
Comptroller
-
General
of
Convicts
,
the
actual
authority
over
the
criminals
in
West
Australia
.
"
"
Then
we
have
a
representative
of
the
Comptroller
-
General
on
board
?
"
"
No.
"
"
Pardon
me
,
4
Mr.
Wyville
,
you
speak
riddles
to
-
day
.
You
said
a
moment
that
ago
every
convict
ship
had
such
a
representative
.
"
"
Yes
,
unless
it
have
the
Comptroller
himself
.
"
"
Then
we
have
--
are
you
the
Comptroller
-
General
?
"
"
Yes
.
The
office
was
vacant
,
and
,
at
the
request
of
the
Prime
Minister
,
I
accepted
a
temporary
appointment
.
I
am
The
glad
it
was
offered
;
for
it
will
enable
me
to
see
our
new
law
fairly
started
.
"
evening
y
had
closed
in
as
they
convened
,
and
now
the
shade
became
somewhat
tolerable
.
Mr.
Wyville
and
Sheridan
had
drawn
their
deck
chairs
towards
the
wheel
-
house
.
"
"
I
am
glad
there
is
a
power
on
board
above
that
of
the
scoundrel
who
commands
the
ship
,
"
said
Sheridan
,
sternly
,
after
a
long
pause
.
Then
he
continued
rapidly
:
"
Mr.
Wyville
,
I
have
feared
every
day
that
I
should
have
to
strangle
the
wretch
,
I
should
have
told
you
before
,
but
something
always
prevented
.
By
:
y
some
strange
fatality
there
is
on
board
this
ship
a
woman
whom
I
have
loved
all
my
life
,
and
who
has
been
mortally
wronged
by
this
man
.
I
have
come
on
this
ship
only
to
protect
her
.
"
Sheridan's
lowered
voice
was
husky
with
deep
emotion
.
Having
said
so
much
,
he
remained
silent
.
Mr.
Wyville
had
been
looking
out
on
the
glassy
and
slow
roll
of
the
waves
.
As
Sheridan
spoke
,
his
lips
and
mouth
closed
with
a
gradual
compression
,
and
a
light
almost
of
alarm
came
into
his
eyes
.
He
was
thinking
of
Alice
Walmsley
"
You
have
loved
her
all
,
"
Since
I
was
a
boy-
I
your
life
,
"
he
repeated
slowly
,
still
looking
at
the
sea
.
-and
she
loved
me
once
.
"
"
Mr.
Wyville
was
about
to
speak
;
but
it
seemed
as
i
if
he
changed
his
mind
.
Still
his
lips
moved
,
but
he
said
nothing
"
Who
is
she
,
and
where
?
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
,
and
in
his
usual
calm
voice
.
"
She
is
a
prisoner
,
"
answered
Sheridan
;
"
and
she
is
confined
in
the
hospital
.
"
"
In
the
hospital
!
"
cried
Wyville
,
starting
to
his
feet
,
with
almost
a
cry
of
joy
then
,
seeing
Sheridan's
face
,
he
controlled
himself
.
"
That
unhappy
one
?
"
Yes
,
"
said
Sheridan
,
sadly
,
thinking
,
that
so
he
described
Alice
Walmsley
.
"
God
help
you
,
my
friend
!
yours
is
a
terrible
grief
.
"
"
I
have
feared
that
he
would
see
her
,
or
that
she
might
see
him
.
"
"
"
Fear
no
more
,
"
said
Wyville
,
tenderly
;
"
I
have
taken
measures
to
prevent
such
a
meeting
.
"
"
You
knew
,
then
?
"
asked
Sheridan
,
surprised
.
"
I
knew
his
guilt
--
but
not
your
sorrow
.
I
knew
that
he
and
she
were
on
this
ship
.
It
was
I
who
brought
him
here
;
and
I
had
beforehand
secured
her
confinement
during
the
voyage
in
the
hospital
.
"
Sheridan
was
surprised
at
this
,
having
so
lately
spoken
to
Sister
Cecilia
on
the
subject
.
But
he
set
it
down
to
the
customary
thoughtfulness
of
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
"
I
cannot
speak
my
gratitude
to
continued
Sheridan
;
you
your
visit
to
her
prison
awakened
in
her
the
life
that
wrong
and
grief
had
crushed
.
I
know
the
whole
story
,
and
I
have
longed
to
speak
my
gratitude
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
deemed
that
Sheridan
referred
to
his
visit
to
Harriet
Draper
in
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
.
But
how
could
Sheridan
have
discovered
it
?
He
had
certainly
never
communicated
with
Harriet
Draper
.
"
How
did
you
learn
of
my
visit
to
her
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
From
the
governor
of
Millbank
.
"
"
Ah
-
yes
I
told
him
.
"
Sheridan
felt
a
great
relief
from
this
confidence
.
He
asked
Mr.
Wyville's
advice
as
to
his
conduct
towards
Draper
during
the
voyage
,
and
was
glad
to
find
that
it
coincided
with
his
own
view
;
to
treat
him
with
cold
neutrality
until
the
Houguemont
had
landed
her
passengers
and
had
ceased
to
be

Sheridan
had
gone

to
his
room

Mr.
Wyville
remained
on
deck
alone
.
His
heart
was
strangely
happy
that
