"
You
don't
?

asked
the
Secretary
.
"
No
,
I
don't
,
"
said
Hamerton
,
rising
from
his
chair
.
"
I
call
it
utter
commonplace
--
for
these
Australians
;
the
most
prosaic
set
of
events
I
have
yet
seen
them
indulge
in
.
I
begin
to
realize
the
meaning
of
the
Antipodes
:
their
common
ways
are
our
extraordinary
ones
--
and
they
don't
seem
to
have
any
uncommon
ones

FOUR
years
had
passed
since
Mr.
Wyville's
visit
to
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
;
and
he
had
heard
no
word
of
the
woman
he
had
then
sought
.
Crare
interest
to
this
student
of
During
this
time
the
case
.
of
Alice
Walmsley
had
grown
to
be
a
subject
of
humanity
.
Scarcely
a
day
had
passed
in
all
that
time
that
he
had
not
devoted
some
moments
to
thinking
,
means
of
affording
her
comfort
and
pleasure
.
the
innocent
prisoner
,
and
devising
some
.
Perhaps
the
secret
of
his
special
observance
of
this
case
arose
.
on
allowable
from
the
fact
that
beneath
the
self
-
imposed
of
suffering
he
beheld
the
golden
idea
.
To
him
this
peaceful
and
silent
adherence
to
a
principle
was
a
source
.
constant
interest
.
In
all
those
years
,
Alice
Walmsley
had
never
heard
his
name
,
and
had
only
.
yonce
seen
his
interference
.
The
memory
of
the
strong
dark
face
that
had
then
interposed
to
save
her
,
and
the
look
of
kind
compassion
,
were
treasured
in
her
heart
;
but
she
knew
no
more
than
this
.
Sister
Cecilia
,
perhaps
,
would
have
told
her
who
this
powerful
I
man
was
;
but
she
shrank
from
asking
,
and
she
never
asked
.
About
a
week
after
the
event
in
the
Committee
Room
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
sitting
with
Sheridan
and
Hamerton
in
his
study
,
received
a
letter
,
brought
from
Scotland
Yard
by
a
policeman
.
As
usual
with
the
group
,
when
not
conversing
,
Sheridan
read
,
and
Hamerton
lounged
.
Mr.
Wyville
started
from
his
seat
with
a
i
an
exclamation
,
when
he
had
read
the
letter
.
He
rarely
betrayed
even
the
slightest
excitement
;
and
Mr.
Hamerton
would
not
have
been
more
surprised
had
a
bomb
exploded
under
the
table
than
he
was
to
see
Mr.
Wyville
thrown
off
his
balance
so
unexpectedly
and
completely
.
Hamerton
,
however
,
had
too
profound
a
respect
for
his
friend
to
speak
his
astonishment
.
"
Thanks
,
kind
and
simple
heart
!
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Wyville
,
holding
the
letter
before
him
.
"
You
have
been
faithful
to
your
word
for
four
years
;
and
you
.
shall
rejoice
for
it
all
your
life
!
"
Then
,
recollecting
himself
,
he
smiled
in
his
grave
way
and
said
-
-
"
I
have
received
long
-
expected
news
.
I
have
found
something
I
sought
.
To
-
night
,
I
must
leave
London
for
a
few
days
;
so
I
must
say
good
-
bye
now
.
"
"
"
Are
you
leaving
England
,
too
?
"
asked
Hamerton
.
"
No
;
I
go
only
to
Lancashire
--to
a
little
village
called
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
.
"
He
turned
to
his
desk
,
and
was
busily
arranging
his
papers
"
Why
,
what's
the
matter
,
Sheridan
?
You
are
growing
nervous
of
late
.
"
on
to
say
that
Walton
was
his
"
The
name
of
the
village
took
me
by
surprise
,
that
is
all
,
"
said
Will
.
He
was
going
native
village
;
but
the
entrance
of
Lord
Somers
temporarily
changed
the
subject
.
Before
it
could
be
resumed
,
Mr.
Wyville
had
said
"
Good
-
bye
,
"
and
the
gentlemen
took
their
leave
.
The
letter
which
Mr.
Wyville
had
received
ran
as
follows
:
"
Sir
,
--The
woman
Harriet
Draper
,
as
was
Samuel
Draper's
wife

he

a
dedly
assault
on
Draper's
sister

and

Lodge
,
Police
Officer

"
Accompanied
by
his
black
servant
,
Mr.
Wyville
left
London
that
evening
;
and
on
t
the
forenoon
of
the
next
day
he
stepped
from
the
train
at
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
,
and
walked
towards
the
police
-
station
or
lock
-
up
It
was
a
small
stone
building
,
containing
,
four
rooms
,
two
of
which
were
Officer
Lodge's
quarters
;
the
third

,
with
a
dock
or
bar

and

desk
;
and

an
window's
,

as

,
with
barred
Mr.
Wyville
pushed
the
outer
door
,
and
stepped
at
once
into
the
court
-
room
,
which
was
empty
.
He
was
about
to
withdraw
,
when
a
door
on
the
left
opened
,
and
Officer
Lodge
,
quite
unchanged
in
four
years
,
greeted
Mr.
Wyville
,
as
if
he
had
seen
him
only
yesterday
.
"
She
was
out
of
horder
bad
,
this
time
,
sir
,
but
I
knew
she'd
turn
up
some
time
.
"
"
Many
thanks
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
I
had
almost
concluded
you
had
forgotten
.
"
Officer
Lodge
was
a
little
hurt
at
this
expression
of
doubt
;
but
he
was
quite
too
mild
of
temper
for
resentment
.
"
Where
is
the
woman
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
Officer
Lodge
pointed
to
the
heavy
door
of
the
lock
-
up
,
with
a
grim
shake
of
the
head
.
He
sank
his
voice
to
a
whisper
.
