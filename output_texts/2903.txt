the
window
,
Mr.
Woodruff
not
having
descended
from
his
room
for
dinner
.
One
would
scarcely
have
thought
that
he
was
expecting
to
meet
,
for
the
first
time
,
his
son
and
heir
,
to
judge
by
his
dark
and
moody
countenance
.
He
was
faultlessly
dressed
in
evening
clothes
,
for
the
fashionable
tailor
to
whom
he
had
repaired
on
landing
in
England
,
had
proved
equal
to
the
task
,
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
an
appearance
to
the
hearthrugs
with
his
back
indicate
an
absence
from
civilized
regions
for
so
long
a
time
.
He
was
standing
.
to
the
fire
,
but
at
the
sound
of
the
wheels
he
left
this
truly
national
position
,
and
walked
down
the
hall
to
receive
his
son
on
the
steps
.
Godfrey
Mornington
was
barely
twenty
-
three
,
but
habits
of
self
-
dependence
,
forced
upon
|
him
by
the
peculiarity
of
his
position
,
had
made
him
older
than
his
years
hence
his
appearance
and
manners
were
eyes
,
in
those
of
a
man
of
riper
age
..
He
was
tall
,
rather
slight
,
with
an
upright
,
athletic
frame
,
fair
hair
and
blue
.
which
was
an
air
of
complete
nonchalance
and
indifference
;
indeed
,
a
leading
and
constant
characteristic
of
his
,
seldom
vanishing
even
for
a
moment
.
It
piqued
women
,
who
could
make
nothing
of
this
good
-
looking
imperturbable
young
fellow
,
only
too`la
mode
;
but
it
excited
the
envy
of
men
,
although
they
accepted
it
as
proof
of
good
breeding
,
and
general
"
good
form
.
"
Some
with
whom
he
was
brought
into
contact
were
irritated
by
it
,
and
put
it
down
to
pride
;
and
,
certainly
in
some
measure
,
Godfrey
was
proud
of
his
name
and
position
.
Howbeit
,
this
shortcoming
was
far
less
apparent
when
amongst
his
inferiors
than
with
his
equals
.
At
any
rate
,
he
was
altogether
free
from
that
vulgar
pride
or
snobism
which
springs
generally
from
the
recent
acquisition
of
money
or
lands
.
A
few
called
him
indolent
,
but
they
judged
wrongly
,
for
indolent
in
its
proper
sense
Godfrey
certainly
was
not
.
At
the
private
school
where
his
guardian
had
placed
him
he
was
the
recognised
leader
in
all
the
sports
,
and
now
at
Oxford
he
was
stroke
of
his
college
eight
,
and
a
member
of
the
University
eleven
.
He
was
popular
there
,
on
the
whole
,
and
deservedly
;
for
he
was
both
generous
and
good
-
natured
,
and
the
few
who
knew
him
intimately
would
maintain
that
there
was
no
better
fellow
in
England
than
Godfrey
Mornington
.
He
had
not
many
friends
there
,
however
,
partly
from
his
own
choice
,
partly
because
he
would
attach
himself
to
neither
the
fast
set
nor
the
studious
,
but
preferred
striking
out
for
himself
a
line
between
the
two
—
a
difficult
task
at
his
college
.
Those
of
his
friends
who
,
knowing
his
worth
and
appreciating
!
his
friendship
,
endeavoured
to
follow
his
lead
,
were
generally
beguiled
after
a
week
or
so
into
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
recognised
sets
.
This
troubled
him
little
,
for
he
was
most
self
-
reliant
.
Lord
Dereham
was
,
perhaps
,
his
only
friend
,
and
he
saw
very
little
of
him
,
as
the
young
heir
to
an
earldom
was
distinctly
a
member
of
the
fast
set
,
whose
orgies
Godfrey
seldom
cared
to
join
.
as
to
the
sire
When
Mr.
Woodruff's
telegram
reached
Godfrey
,
he
was
in
Scotland
,
shooting
,
but
immediately
he
caught
the
first
train
south
,
and
now
,
his
journey
at
an
end
,
he
could
not
restrain
nervous
apprehensions
whom
he
had
never
seen
.
•
They
flitted
,
however
,
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
man
who
stood
on
the
steps
waiting
for
him
,
and
whose
identity
he
understood
at
once
.
He
was
somewhat
surprised
at
first
.
Somehow
,
he
had
I
got
the
impression
,
not
a
very
unreasonable
one
,
that
he
should
see
a
haggard
-
looking
man
,
with
long
dishevelled
beard
,
and
evidences
of
neglect
in
his
clothing
,
and
perhaps
with
hard
hands
and
awkward
manners
.
He
thought
that
over
a
score
years
spent
,
presumably
in
poverty
,
in
a
far
-
off
land
,
would
to
a
certain
extent
have
taken
away
the
outward
appearance
of
good
birth
.
And
yet
,
the
person
who
waited
to
greet
him
,
by
his
bearing
and
the
fit
of
his
clothes
,
might
have
lived
all
his
life
in
clubdom
.
It
must
be
confessed
that
this
was
a
great
relief
to
Godfrey
.
He
had
not
inherited
Eva's
romantic
disposition
,
nor
her
warm
heart
,
and
he
did
not
profess
to
entertain
overwhelming
affection
for
a
father
whom
he
had
never
seen
.
He
was
prepared
,
whatever
sort
of
his
father
might
be
,
to
become
a
dutiful
son
to
him
.
This
behaviour
would
not
have
been
in
the
slightest
degree
less
respectful
,
if
,
instead
of
the
well
-
dressed
gentleman
,
here
had
been
a
man
whom
misfortune
had
ruined
,
and
who
had
,
forgetting
his
birth
,
adopted
the
manners
and
speech
,
even
appearance
,
of
the
very
lowest
classes
with
whom
he
might
have
been
compelled
to
mix
.
Yet
,
none
the
less
,
the
impression
of
this
possibility
was
almost
a
nightmare
,.
a
man
so
utterly
conventional
was
his
disposition
,
and
there
was
relief
as
well
as
welcome
in
his
smile
as
he
held
out
his
hand
.
Again
he
was
agreeably
surprised
,
for
his
father
received
him
,
though
kindly
,
without
the
slightest
"
gush
,
"
and
as
they
strolled
down
the
hall
towards
the
library
,
he
felt
that
he
should
be
able
to
get
on
with
this
Chesterfield
*
better
than
he
anticipated
.
Arrived
in
the
library
,
Mr.
Mornington
seated
himself
i
son
to
one
apposite
him
.
in
an
easy
chair
,
and
motioned

allusion
to
the
relationship
between
Lord
Chesterfield
and
his

Chesterfield

popular
Letters
to
His
Son
(
published
posthumously
in
1774
)
,
a
manual
on
and
succeeding
in
society
that
stressed
the
importance
of
appearances
