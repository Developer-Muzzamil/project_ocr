Taking
this
as
an
agreement
with
his
request
,
Mr.
Sheridan
resolved
that
his
conduct
towards
the
captain
should
be
absolutely
reserved
,
until
the
vessel
reached
port
.
Then
,
what
to
do
was
beset
with
difficulties
.
That
dire
punishment
should
overtake
the
villain
was
clear
;
but
what
if
his
public
arraignment
would
disturb
the
peace
of
Alice
,
whose
slowly
healing
wounds
would
thus
be
torn
open
?
Instead
of
coming
to
a
decision
,
Sheridan
resolved
that
on
the
first
opportunity
he
would
lay
the
whole
matter
before
Mr.
Wyville
,
and
follow
his
advice
.
Soon
after
entering
the
tropics
,
the
Houguemont
had
caught
the
trade
winds
,
and
sailed
swiftly
down
the
level
seas
.
4.
Her
tall
masts
dwindled
pigmy
-
like
as
she
passed
beneath
the
awful
shadow
of
Teneriffe
.
Her
sky
-
sails
cut
a
line
on
the
cliff
a
finger's
breadth
from
the
sea
;
while
above
her
towered
into
the
air
the
twelve
thousand
feet
of
tremendous
pinnacle
.
She
coasted
the
2
great
North
-
western
bulge
of
Africa
,
and
here
,
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
England
,
her
speed
was
checked
,
the
trade
winds
faded
and
died
,
the
sea
lost
its
ripples
,
but
kept
its
waves
,
that
rose
and
fell
slowly
,
with
long
monotonous
rolls
,
like
an
ocean
of
molten
glass
.
The
sails
of
the
Houguemont
slapped
backwards
and
forwards
,
the
ropes
hung
useless
,
the
pennant
clung
down
the
mast
.
The
convict
ship
was
becalmed
,
off
the
coast
of
Africa
,
seven
degrees
above
the
Line
.
The
faces
of
the
ship's
officers
grew
serious
when
the
wind
died
.
They
did
not
welcome
a
calm
in
such
a
latitude
,
and
at
that
season
.
The
heat
was
intense
and
continuous
,
scarcely
lowering
by
ten
degrees
at
night
.
"
I
wish
we
were
five
degrees
to
the
westward
,
"
said
Sheridan
to
Mr.
Wyville
,
his
old
marine
lore
recurring
to
him
,
"
I
hate
this
Gulf
of
Guinea
.
"
"
Why
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
,
standing
in
the
shade
of
a
sail
,
while
the
young
military
officer
sat
beside
Sheridan
on
the
rail
"
I
hate
it
first
for
its
sharks
-
-
you
can't
dip
your
!
hand
in
this
water
,
for
a
thousand
miles
south
and
east
,
without
having
it
snapped
off
.
I
hate
it
for
its
low
coast
,
where
so
many
splendid
ships
have
sailed
straight
to
destruction
.
I
hate
it
for
its
siroccos
,
whirlwinds
,
and
,
above
all
,
I
hate
it
for
its
fevers
.
I
don't
think
there's
anything
good
about
the
coast
of
Guinea
.
"
"
"
That
is
a
bad
showing
,
certainly
,
"
said
the
military
officer
.
"
Yes
,
and
it's
quite
true
,
"
continued
Sheridan
.
"
No.
one
can
say
a
good
word
about
this
coast
.
"
"
Not
so
fast
,
not
so
fast
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
smiling
at
Sheridan's
earnestness
.
"
On
this
very
coast
,
within
two
hundred
miles
of
us
,
is
being
solved
one
.
of
the
most
interesting
political
problems
in
human
history
.
Yonder
lies
a
settlement
with
a
national
story
unequalled
for
dignity
and
pathos
.
"
Sheridan
and
the
young
soldier
looked
up
,
"
What
is
it
?
"
asked
Sheridan
.
astonished
.
"
The
Republic
of
Liberia
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
Sheridan
looked
at
the
soldier
,
who
,
at
the
same
moment
,
looked
at
him
.
They
both
smiled
broadly
,
confessing
their
ignorance
.
"
I
was
too
busy
with
sandalwood
-
-
"
began
Sheridan
.
"
And
I
with
tactics
,
"
said
the
soldier
,
"
But
what
is
this
Republic
,
sir
?
"
"
A
new
country
,
honestly
acquired
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
;
the
only
country
.
on
earth
not
torn
by
force
from
its
rightful
owners
.
A
country
where
slaves
have
peacefully
founded
a
nation
of
elevated
freedom
,
where
black
men
have
faced
God
in
manly
dignity
,
and
declared
their
right
to
wipe
out
the
scriptural
curse
;
whose
citizenship
is
an
honour
to
the
holder
,
and
whose
citizens
are
an
honour
to
mankind
.
"
Who
are
the
citizens
?
"
asked
the
surprised
officer
.
"
"
Slaves
from
America
!
"
said
Wyville
,
with
an
earnestness
that
made
them
forget
the
heat
;
"
men
who
bear
on
their
bodies
the
marks
of
the
lash
,
and
on
their
minds
the
rust
of
accursed
laws
;
men
who
might
be
pardoned
for
hating
their
kind
.
God
bless
them
and
,
"
as
he
spoke
,
he
looked
away
in
the
direction
of
the
land
;
"
the
kindest
and
most
amiable
race
on
earth
.
They
have
carried
with
them
from
the
great
Republic
of
the
West
only
that
which
was
good
-
-
its
first
principles
.
Its
unrepublican
practices
they
have
left
behind
.
'
།།
"
Will
they
not
became
corrupt
?
"
asked
Sheridan
.
"
When
?
"
"
When
they
become
rich
,
"
said
the
officer
innocently
.
"
It
is
to
be
feared
,
"
answered
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
But
they
have
one
.
climate
is
deadly
to
white
men
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
The
safeguard
.
"
"
What
is
that
?
"
"
Their
appearance
of
Captain
Draper
,
coming
from
his
stateroom
,
interrupted
the
conversation
.
The
young
officer
stopped
to
chat
with
him
,
while
Mr.
Wyville
and
Sheridan
walked
to
the
other
side
of
the
poop
"
There
are
two
powers
of
government
represented
on
this
ship
,
"
said
Sheridan
,
determined
to
bring
the
conversation
to
the
point
he
wished
to
speak
about
:
"
which
is
in
command
--
the
civil
or
military
?
The
captain
of
the
vessel
,
or
the
military
officer
?
"
