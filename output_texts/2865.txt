Comptroller

General
!
"
As
Sister
Cecilia
spoke
,
she
still
embraced
Alice
,
and
looked
down
at
her
face
.
But
there
was
no
change
,
except
a
slight
contraction
of
the
brow
-
muscles
denoting
awakened
interest
.
an
perceptible
the
Queen's
ship
!
"
"
And
she
,
who
was
a
poor
prisoner
an
hour
ago
,
is
now
a
respected
passenger
continued
Sister
Cecilia
,
lightly
;
but
in
truth
she
was
alarmed
at
Alice's
calmness
.
"
It
is
a
woman
,
then
?
"
said
Alice
.
"
Yes
,
dear
;
a
woman
who
has
been
nine
years
in
prison
,
suffering
for
another's
crime
.
And
that
other
has
confessed
-
-
Alice
!
Alice
!
"
cried
Sister
Cecilia
,
dismayed
at
the
effect
of
her
words
.
But
Alice
did
not
hear
;
she
had
slipped
from
her
seat
,
pale
as
marble
,
fainting
;
and
were
it
not
for
the
supporting
would
have
fallen
headlong
to
the
floor
.
Sister
Cecilia
did
not
alarm
anyone
arms
of
the
nun
she
;
she
was
experienced
in
emotional
climaxes
.
She
did
the
few
things
proper
for
the
moment
,
then
quietly
awaited
Alice's
recovery
In
a
few
minutes
the
pale
face
was
raised
,
and
the
mild
eyes
sought
Sister
Cecilia
as
if
they
asked
a
heartrending
question
.
The
little
Sister
did
not
understand
the
appeal
,
so
she
only
encouraged
Alice
by
a
kind
word
to
regain
strength
.
"
And
she
!
"
whispered
Alice
,
with
quivering
lips
,
now
speaking
what
she
had
looked
;
"
where
is
she
--the
forsaken
one
?
"
"
She
is
on
board
,
child
;
she
is
a
prisoner
,
and
a
most
unhappy
.
She
has
no
hope
but
the
peace
of
my
atonement
.
God
send
her
comfort
!
one
.
"
Amen
!
Amen
!
"
cried
Alice
,
laying
her
head
on
the
Sister's
arm
,
and
sobbing
without
restraint
.
THE
NEW
PENAL
LAW
THERE
being
no
female
passengers
in
the
cabin
of
the
Houguemont
,
it
was
decided
that
Alice
Walmsley
should
remain
in
her
room
with
Sister
Cecilia
till
the
end
of
the
voyage
.
The
only
change
made
was
in
her
dress
,
and
this
,
by
some
strange
foresight
on
the
p
part
of
the
little
Sister
,
as
it
seemed
,
was
quite
extensively
and
fittingly
provided
for
.
very
Alice
selected
the
quietest
possible
dress
,
and
when
she
stood
arrayed
in
it
,
after
so
many
weary
years
in
prison
gray
she
could
not
help
glancing
at
her
face
in
the
glass
,
and
blushing
as
she
looked
;
and
at
this
pretty
and
womanly
moment
,
Sister
Cecilia
came
upon
her
and
gave
a
pleasant
little
laugh
.
Upon
this
,
Alice
blushed
deeper
,
and
turned
her
confused
face
away
,
while
Sister
Cecilia
reached
after
it
,
and
drawing
it
to
the
light
kissed
her
affectionately
.
"
Why
,
Alice
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
provoking
smile
,
"
you
"
are
quite
a
beauty
.
"
Unquestionably
,
even
a
few
days
without
the
burden
of
bondage
had
worked
wonders
in
Alice's
life
.
She
was
na
longer
moody
;
she
instantly
and
naturally
began
to
take
fresh
interest
in
everything
she
saw
and
heard
around
her
.
The
ship
cleared
the
Tropics
and
raced
down
towards
the
Cape
in
the
vigorous
Southern
trades
.
The
blustering
winds
and
the
rough
sea
brought
refreshment
even
to
the
feeble
,
and
to
Alice
renewed
strength
.
Her
face
lost
the
pallor
of
confinement
,
and
her
step
became
elastic
.
The
years
of
her
imprisonment
had
kept
dormant
the
energies
that
waste
with
exertion
.
She
began
to
feel
as
youthful
and
as
cheerful
as
when
she
was
a
girl
.
One
day
she
was
standing
beside
her
open
window
,
looking
out
on
the
sea
,
when
she
plainly
heard
above
her
,
on
the
poop
deck
,
a
voice
that
held
her
rooted
to
the
spot
.
"
I
cannot
forsee
the
result
"
--she
heard
these
words-
-
"
but
I
shall
,
I
go
on
to
the
end
.
I
have
loved
her
clearly
always
;
and
I
shall
,
at
least
,
prove
it
to
her
before
the
dream
is
dispelled
.
"
Alice
held
herself
to
the
window
,
not
meaning
to
listen
to
the
words
so
much
as
to
obey
the
strong
prompting
of
her
heart
to
hear
the
honest
ring
of
the
voice
.
It
was
Will
Sheridan
who
spoke
--he
stood
on
the
poop
with
Mr.
Wyville
--
and
Alice
knew
the
voice
.
After
so
many
years
,
it
came
to
her
like
a
message
from
her
girlhood
,
and
bridged
over
the
chasm
in
her
life
.
No
other
words
reached
her
;
but
the
conversation
continued
for
a
long
time
,
and
still
she
stood
beside
the
window
,
her
cheek
laid
on
her
hands
,
while
she
allowed
the
familiar
tones
to
transport
her
back
to
happy
scenes
.
Sister
Cecilia
found
her
so
,
and
playfully
coaxed
her
to
tell
her
thoughts
;
but
Alice's
diffidence
was
so
evident
that
the
little
nun
sat
down
and
laughed
heartily
.
The
voyage
round
the
Cape
had
no
special
interest
;
and
a
few
weeks
later
the
officers
began
their
preparations
for
disembarkation
.
The
air
grew
balmy
