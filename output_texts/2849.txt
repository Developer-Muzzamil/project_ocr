and
as
she
spoke
she
saw
clearly
in
her
mind's
eye
the
little
neglected
and
forgotten
grave
.
"
Good

bye
,
my
darling
--
for
ever
--
for

!
"
She
buried
her
face
in
the
bed
,
and
wept
bitterly
and
long
.

softly

Sister
Cecilia
leant
over
her
,
and
placed
beside
her
hand
a
little
box
,
covered
with
white
paper
,
on
which
lay
sealed
letter
.
Having
done
so
,
the
Sister
laid
her
hand
caressingly
on
Alice's
head
,
and
withdrew
quietly
.
It
was
many
a
4
minutes
before
Alice
raised
her
tear
-
stained
face
.
As
she
did
so
,
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
little
box
,
and
,
saw
the
letter
.
She
did
not
heed
it
at
first
,
thinking
it
was
Sister
Cecilia's
.
But
another
instant
,
and
she
had
read
her
own
name
-
-
"
Alice
Walmsley
"
.
-
-
written
on
the
letter
,
and
in
a
hand
that
was
strangely
familiar
.
The
written
name
itself

familiar
than
the
handwriting
Something
thrilled
her
as
she
took
the
little
box
in
her
hand
,
and
opened
it
.
She
found
within
a
piece
of
soft
mould
,
in
which
some
sweet
young
grass
was
growing
,
and
on
one
side
a
fresh
wild
flower
,
that
must
have
been
pulled
that
day
.
As
she
looked
,
with
blurred
sight
,
the
meaning
of
the
blessed
gift
poured
into
her
heart
like
balm
,
and
her
thought
rose
up
to
heaven
in
an
ecstasy
of
gratitude
.
She
did
not
need
to
look
at
the
letter
;
she
divined
its
contents
.
But
at
length
she
took
it
,
and
broke
the
seal
,
and
read
the
few
words
it
contained
:
-
-
"
Dear
Alice
,
--
The
grass
and
flowers
were
growing
this
morning
on
your
baby's
grave
.
The
wild
flowers
have
covered
it
for
years
.
I
hope
it
shall
never
be
neglected
nor
disturbed
.
Yours
faithfully

SHERIDAN
An
hour
later
,
Sister
Cecilia
entered
the
outer
room
,
purposely
making
a
noise
to
distract
Alice's
reverie
.
But
she
had
to
come
at
last
and
touch
her
arm
,
and
take
the
box
and
the
letter
from
her
hands
,
before
Alice
realized
the
revelation
that
had
come
to
her
.
She
did
not
see
it
even
then
as
a
whole
;
but
piece

piece
in
her
mind
the
incredible
happiness
dawned
upon
her

another

The
last
words
of
the
letter
repeated
themselves
like
a
strain
of
distant
music
in
her
ears
:
"

--and
though
the
sense
that
was
touched
had
in
it
a
tone
of
pain
and
reproach
that
smote
her
,
it
roused
her
from
further
dwelling
on
her
own
unhappiness
.
THE
SAILING
OF
THE
HOUGUEMONT
.
THE
last
convict
had
been
sent
below
.
The
barred
doors
in
the
railed
hatchways
were
locked
.
The
hundreds
of
cooped
criminals
mingled
with
each
other
freely
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
.
The
sentries
had
been
posted
at
the
hatches
and
passages
on
deck
.
The
sailors
had
shaken
out
the
sails
.
The
capstan
had
been
worked
until
every

.
She
only
awaited
the
coming
of
her
commander
.
Mr.
Wyville
walked
to
and
fro
an
the
deck
poop
casting
now
and
again
a
searching
glance
at
the
pier
and
the
steep
cliff
road
.
At
length
his
pace
became
less
regular
,
and
his
usually
imperturbable
face
betrayed
impatience
.
It
was
two
hours
past
the
time
when
the
captain
had
engaged
to
be
on
board
.
As
Mr.
Wyville
stood
looking
landward
,
with
a
darkened
brow
,
the
chief
warder
in
command
of
the
prison
officers
,
rapidly
approached
him
,
with
an
excited
air
,
and
saluted
in
military
fashion
.
"
Well
,
Mr.
Gray
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
turning
,
"
what
is
it
?

not
on
board
-
-
he
must
have
slipped
overboard
from
the
soldiers
,
and
attempted
to
swim
ashore
.
"
"
When
did
he
came
on
board
?
"
"
With
the
last
chain
,
sir
.
"
"
Then
he
must
be
in
the
water
still
.
He
would
strike
for
the
mainland
,
not
for
the
island
.
"
As
he
spoke
,
a
soldier
,
who
had
run
up
the
rigging
,
shouted
that
there
was
a
hamper
or
basket
floating
a
short
distance
astern
of
the
ship
.
Mr.
Wyville
asked
one
of
the
ship's
officers
for
a
glass
,
which
he
levelled
at
the
floating
basket
.
He
saw
that
it
moved
obliquely
towards
the
shore
of
the
mainland
,
though
a
strong
tide
was
setting
in
the
contrary
direction
,
towards
the
island
.
He
lowered
the
glass
with
a
saddened
air
.
"
Poor
fellow
!
"
he
murmured
,
shutting
the
glass
,
irresolutely
.
He
knew
that
the
absconder
,
finding
the
floating
hamper
,
had
placed
it
over
his
head
in
order
to
escape
the
eyes
of
the
guards
.
As
he
laid
down
the
telescope
,
