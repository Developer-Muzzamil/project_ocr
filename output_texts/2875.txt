river

were
as

as

hour
before
,

Sheridan
,
though
he
loved
nature
,
saw
none
of
them
.
He
walked
rapidly
at
first
,
then
he
slackened
his
and
broke
off
a
branch
here
and
there
as
he
passed
,
and
threw
it
away
again
.
When
he
came
to
the
river
,
and
stood
and
looked
this
way
and
that
for
Alice
,
all
the
determination
with
which
he
had
set
out
had
disappeared
.
But
Alice
was
not
in
sight
.
He
walked
along
by
the
river
bank
,
and
in
a
f
few
minutes
he
saw
her
coming
towards
him
beneath
the
trees
.
He
stood
still
and
waited
for
her
.
She
walked
rapidly
.
When
within
ten
yards
of
where
he
stood
she
turned
from
the
river
,
to
cross
the
bush
towards
the
house
.
She
had
not
seen
him
,
and
in
a
minute
she
would
be
out
of
sight
.
Sheridan
took
a
few
paces
towards
her
and
stopped
.
"
Alice
,
"
he
said
aloud
.
She
turned
and
saw
him
standing
with
I
an
eager
face
,
his
hands
reached
out
towards
her
.
Every
premeditated
word
was
forgotten
.
She
gave
one
look
at
the
face
,
so
little
changed
;
she
felt
the
deep
emotion
in
voice
,
and
act
,
and
feature
,
and
her
heart
responded
impulsively
and
imperatively
.
She
only
spoke
"

He
came
one
word
forward
,
his
eyes
on
hers
,
and
the
eyes
of
both
were
brimming
.
Without
a
word
they
met
.
Alice
put
out
both
her
hands
,
and
he
took
them
and
held
them
,
and
after
a
while
he
raised
them
,
one
after
the
other
,
to
his
lips
,
and
kissed
them
.
Then
they
turned
towards
the
house
and
walked
on
together
in
silence
.
Their
hearts
were
too
full
for
words
.
They
understood
without
speech
.
Their
sympathy
was
so
deep
and
unutterable
that
it

for
the

only
reached
his

through

It
was

,
but
it
was
completely

and

.
They
had

all
that

and
he
went
away
with
a
satisfied
heart
.
On
that
morning
Mr.
Wyville
had
started
early
for
Fremantle
,
his
mind
revolving
two
important
steps
which
he
meant
to
take
that
day
.
Since
the
arrival
of
the
ship
he
had
been
disquieted
by
the
presence
of
Draper
in
the
colony
.
He
questioned
his
own
wisdom
in
bringing
him
there
,
or
in
keeping
him
there
when
he
might
have
let
him
goi
But
,
in
his
wide
experience
of
,
had
discovered
,
under
the
most
unsightly
and
inharmonious
natures
,
some
secret
chord
that
,
when
ance
struck
,
brought
the
heart
up
to
the
full
tone
of
human
kindness
.
This
chord
he
had
sought
for
in
Draper
.

Wyville

he
had
hoped
that
,
in
the
day
of
humiliation
,
his
heart
would
return
to
her
he
had
so
cruelly
wronged
.
There
was
only
one
step
more
to
be
taken
--
to
release
Harriet
,
and
,
if
she
would
,
let
her
seek
her
husband
,
and
appeal
once
more
to
his
humanity
.
On
this
day
Mr.
Wyville
intended
to
issue
a
pardon
to
Harriet
Draper
.
The
Government
had

Alice

This
done
,
Mr.
Wyville
set
his
mind
towards
Perth
,
where
,
on
his
return
that
day
,
he
was
to
enter
on
another
act
of
even
deeper
personal
importance
.
Somehow
,
his
heart
was

as
he

of

he

bank

In

portico
sat
a
woman
on
