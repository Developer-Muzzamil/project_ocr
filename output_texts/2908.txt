"
Really
,
sir
,
"
stammered
poor
Hassop
with
eyes
ever
fixed
eagerly
on
the
note
,
"
it's
against
rules
and
a
great
risk
,
but
to
oblige
a
real
gentleman
—

,
in

,

!
I'll
do
it

he
went
on
more
briskly
,
the
Rubicon
being
past
,
"
I
will
be
here
again
with
the
book
,
"
and
out
he
hurried
.
Lunch
was
brought
in
to
the
tempter
;
but
he
scarcely
touched
it
,
drinking
a
quantity
of
wine
,
however
,
an
unusual
thing
for
him
.
Before
the
half
-
hour
was
up
,!
Mr.
Hassop
reappeared
breathless
,
bringing
with
him
the
book
.
Mr.
Mornington
took
it
,
and
after
turning
over
the
leaves
for
a
few
moments
,
ostentatiously
copied
an
entry
dated
Robert
Gray
,
bachelor
,
and
Annie
Wood
,
spinster
.
Then

a
marriage

years
the
book
carelessly
from
him
,
he
nodded
to
the
clerk
and
handed
him
the
note
.
"
"
I
am

obliged

you
he
said
,
"
for

walk

May
I
offer
you
a
glass
of
wine
?
"
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Hassop
,
as
he
folded
the
note
up
and
put
it
carefully
into
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
"
What

pointing
to

Left
alone
,
Mr.
Mornington
snatched
the
register
hastily
towards
him
,
and
began
turning
over
the
leaves
rapidly
y
near
the
commencement
of
the
book
,
where
he
had
not
previously
looked
,
suddenly
he
stopped
,
and
a
peculiar
smile
appeared
as
he
read
the
entry
before
him
.
Turning
the
leaf
down
,
he
walked
to
the
door
and
,
opening
it
,
listened
.
No
one
was
about
,
and
the
only
sound
was
the
footsteps
of
the
landlord
and
Mr.
Hassop
as
they
descended
together
into
the
cellar
.
Rapidly
the
gentleman
regained
his
place
,
and
opening
the
book
at
the
entry
he
had
marked
,
laid
the
carving
-
knife
blade
underneath
the
leaf
.
Then
,
taking
out
a
pocket
-
knife
,
He
folded
it

up
with
a
single
sweep
he
cut
the
|
clean
out
close
to
the
binding
,
leaving
no
sign
.
and
put
it
away
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
replacing
the
book
exactly
in
its
former
position
.
When
Mr.
Hassop
reappeared
in
triumph
with
a
dusty
old
bottle
carefully
reclining
in
a
wine
basket
,
Mr.
Mornington
was
standing
near
the
door
,
regarding
with
every
appearance
of
interest
a
yellowed
print
on
the
wall
.
"
You
will
find
this
superior
,
sir
,
"
Mr.
Hassop
exclaimed
.
"
Hard
work
I
had
to
get
over
old
Harris
to
fetch
it
up
,
for
he
is
very
proud
of
his
port
,
and
I
do
believe
lessens
the
small
hoard
with
more
and
more
sorrow
every
time
.
Well
,
may
the
be
chary
of
it
,
"
he
continued
,
as
he
uncorked
the
bottle
with
a
reverent
hand
and
poured
out
two
glassesful
with
a
tenderness
Mr.
Harris
himself
could
not
have
surpassed
.
Mr.
Mornington
tasted
and
approved
,
and
Hassop
sipped
and
sipped
as
if
he
were
enjoying
,
like
Tantalus
in
a
brief
cessation
of
his
punishment
,
a
veritable
nectar
.
In
half
an
hour
Mr.
Mornington
left
him
to
finish
the
bottle
,
the
conveyance
being
ready
to
take
him
to
the
station
.
as
He
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
train
back
to
Oxford
,
and
had
just
ensconced
himself
comfortably
in
the
corner
of
a
first
-
class
carriage
,
when
the
down
train
came
in
on
the
other
side
.
Glancing
idly
into
the
windows
of
the
carriages

train
slackened

Mr.
Mornington
suddenly
started
violently
,
and
a
look
of
amazement
,
not
unmixed
with
alarm
,
appeared
on
his
face
.
For
the
carriage
which
stopped

with
his
had
for
its
solitary
occupant
Mr.
Woodruff
.
"
A

he
muttered
,
as
he
pulled
down
the
blind
.
"
An
hour
later
,
and
I
should
have
been
checkmated
,

.
You
may
spare
yourself
the
trouble
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
watched
Mr.
Woodruff
pass
through
the
station
and
walk
along
the
dusty
lane
towards
the
village
;
"

seek
is
As
if
the
idea
pleased
him
,
he
gave
a
short
unpleasant
laugh
.
As
the
train
moved
out
of
the
station
,
he
relapsed
into
his
persistent
occupation
:
deep
thought
.
Arrived
at
Paddington
,
he
drove
straight
to
a
Strand
restaurant
,
where
he
dined
,
and
wrote
a
few
lines
to
Eva
,
and
then
he
proceeded
to
King's
Cross
Station
.
Here
he
took
an
express
ticket
for
a
small
town
in
a
north
-
eastern
county
.
Again
he
was
alone
in
the
compartment
,
but
although
his
journey
would
take
him
the
whole
of
the
night
,
he
did
not
make
any
preparations
for
sleep
.
In
strange
contrast
to
his
ordinary
state
,
a
very
demon
of
restlessness
possessed
him
He
lit
a
cigar
,
but
threw
it
out
of
window
almost
at
once
.
He
opened
the
evening
paper
and
tried
by
the
uncertain
lamp
-
light
to
read
,
but
in
a
few
moments
the
paper
had
fallen
from
his
hands
,
and
with
knitted
brow
,
and
frequent
changes
of
