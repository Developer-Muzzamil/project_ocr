told
him
that
he
and
his
chief
were
routed
beyond
hope
of
recovery
.
TWO
HEADS
AGAINST
ONE
.
SIR
JOSHUA
HOBB
sat
in
his
Department
Office
in
Parliament
street
,
with
every
sign
of
perplexity
and
his
face
and
attitude
.
His
contest
of
authority
with
the
unknown
and
mysterious
man
had
fairly
crushed
him
.
In
the
face
of
the
officials
whom
he
had
trained
to
regard
his
word
as
the
utterance
of
Power
itself
,
never
to
be
questioned
nor
disobeyed
,
he
had
been
challenged
,
commanded
,
degraded
.
It
was
a
bitter
draught
;
and
what
if
he
had
only
taken
the
first
sickening
mouthful
?
He
was
interrupted
in
his
morose
reflections
by
the
entrance
of
Mr.
Haggett
,
whose
air
was
almost
as
as
his
superior's
.
dejected
Haggett
stood
silently
at
the
door
,
looking
at
the
great
man
,
somewhat
as
a
a
spaniel
might
look
at
its
master
.
The
spare
curtain
of
his
lip
was
folded
into
leathery
Wrinkles
round
his
capacious
mouth
.
"
Haggett
,
"
said
Sir
Joshua
,
turning
wearily
to
the
fire
,
"
who
the
devil
is
this
man
?
"
"
He's
a
rich
Australian-
-
"
began
Haggett
,
in
a
confidential
voice
.
"
Ass
!
"
said
the
Chief
Director
,
without
looking
at
him
.
Mr.
Haggett
,
returning
not
even
a
glance
of
resentment
,
accepted
the
correction
,
and
remained
silent
.
"
Haggett
,
"
said
Sir
Joshua
,
after
a
pause
,
during
which
he
had
stared
into
the
fire
,
when
does
the
convict
ship
sail
?
"
"
In
two
weeks
,
sir
.
"
"
I
want
you
to
go
to
West
Australia
on
that
ship
,
Haggett
.
"
"
I
,
Sir
Joshua
?
Leave
London
?
I
shall
be
ordained
this
year
.
I
shall--
"
personally
assist
you
with
my
influence
.
"
"
Well
,
Sir
Joshua
?
"
"
No
one
else
can
do
it
,
Haggett
.
"
"
Pshaw
!
I
want
you
man
No
one
else
will
do
.
You
can
attend
to
private
matters
on
your
return
.
I
shall
I
find
"
What
is
to
be
done
,
sir
?
"
"
I
want
to
know
all
that
is
to
be
known
in
West
Australia
about
this
Wyville
.
"
"
Do
you
suspect
anything
,
sir
?
"
asked
Mr.
Haggett
.
"
No
;
I
have
no
reason
either
for
suspicion
or
belief
.
I
know
absolutely
nothing
about
the
man
,
nor
can
.
any
one
who
does
.
"
"
And
yet
.
"
that
commission--
"
"
"
Yes
,
that
was
a
disappointment
.
In
one
or
two
cases
I
have
heard
of
the
same
high
influence
,
given
in
the
same
secret
manner
.
"
"
Were
the
other
holders
mysterious
,
too
?
"
asked
Haggett
,
reflectively
,
folding
and
unfolding
his
facial
hangings
.
"
They
were
all
cases
in
which
philanthropists
might
meet
with
opposition
from
officials
;
and
this
strange
but
unquestionable
power
was
given
as
as
a
kind
of
private
commission
.
"
"
It
strikes
down
all
the
rules
-
-
"
"
"
"
Yes
,
Yes
,
"
interrupted
Sir
Joshua
,
striking
the
coal
with
the
tongs
;
"
but
there
it
is
.
It
must
be
acknowledged
without
"
Have
question
you
no
"
clue
to
the
reason
for
which
this
special
authority
was
given
to
him
?
"
asked
Haggett
.
"
I
have
not
thought
of
it
;
but
I
am
not
surprised
.
This
man
,
as
you
know
,
has
reformed
the
Indian
Penal
System
at
the
Andaman
Islands
,
expending
immense
sums
of
his
own
money
to
carry
out
the
change
.
Afterwards
,
he
was
received
by
the
French
Emperor
as
an
authority
on
the
treatment
of
crime
,
and
had
much
to
do
with
their
new
transportation
scheme
.
A
man
with
this
record
,
accepted
by
the
Prime
Minister
,
was
just
the
person
to
be
specially
commissioned
by
the
Queen
.
"
"
He
is
young
to
be
so
very
wealthy
,
"
mused
Haggett
.
"
Yes
,
that
is
mysterious
;
and
report
to
me
"
;
no
one
knows
the
source
of
his
wealth
.
This
is
your
mission
:
find
out
all
about
him
,
by
mail
within
six
months
.
"
"
Then
I
am
really
to
to
Australia
?
"
said
Haggett
,
with
a
doleful
aspect
.
go
"
Yes
,
Haggett
;
there's
no
other
way
.
Inquiry
into
mysterious
men's
lives
is
always
worth
the
trouble
.
You
may
learn
nothing
,
but
--
it
had
better
be
done
.
"
"
Well
,
Sir
Joshua
,
I
want
a
a
favour
from
you
in
return
.
"
"
What
is
it
?
You
shall
have
it
,
if
it
he
in
my
power
.
"
"
Send
that
prisoner
,
Number
Four
,
on
the
ship
;
but
countermand
the
order
for
the
Papist
n
nun
.
"
You
want
the
nun
to
remain
?
