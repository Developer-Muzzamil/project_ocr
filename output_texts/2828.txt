and
had
been
pensioned
for
s
some
active
service
in
certain
vague
Chinese
bombardments
.
It
was
queerly
inconsistent
to
hear
the
old
fellow
relate
wild
stories
of
carnage
,
with
a
woman's
voice
and
a
timid
maiden
air
.
As
Mr.
Wyville
approached
Officer
Lodge
,
that
guardian
of
the
peace
was
laboriously
trying
to
turn
the
barrel
in
its
bed
,
so
that
he
might
paint
the
under
side
.
The
weight
was
too
great
for
the
old
man
,
and
he
was
puzzled
.
He
stood
looking
at
the
ponderous
cask
with
a
divided
mind
.
"
Raise
it
on
its
end
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
who
had
reached
the
spot
unseen
by
the
aquarian
policeman
.
Officer
Lodge
looked
at
him
in
distrust
,
fearing
sarcasm
in
the
remark
;
but
he
met
the
grave
impressive
look
,
and
was
mollified
.
Besides
,
the
advice
struck
him
as
being
practical
.
Without
a
word
,
he
easily
heaved
the
upright
position
,
and
found
that
he
could
paint
its
whole
circumference
.
This
cask
into
an
humour
.
"
If
that
were
my
put
barrel
,
I
should
paint
the
hoops
red
instead
of
green
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Why
?
"
asked
Officer
Lodge
,
dipping
his
brush
in
the
green
paint
.
green
paint
corrodes
it
.
"
him
in
good
"
Because
red
lead
preserves
iron
,
while
the
verdigris
used
to
colour
Officer
Lodge
wiped
his
brush
on
the
rim
of
the
paint
-
pot
,
and
looked
at
Mr.
Wyville
timidly
,
but
pleasantly
.
"
You
know
things
,
you
do
,
"
he
said
.
"
But
suppose
you
!
hadn't
no
red
paint
?
"
"
I
should
paint
the
whole
barrel
white
-
-
white
lead
preserves
iron
--
and
then
give
the
hoops
a
smart
coat
of
black
.
That
would
make
a
handsome
barrel
.
"
"
I
should
think
so
!
By
jewkins
!
wouldn't
it
so
?
"
said
Officer
Lodge
.
Mr.
Wyville
stood
on
the
road
talking
with
the
old
,
until
that
man
,
personage
had
quite
decided
to
paint
the
barrel
white
.
"
Now
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
could
you
direct
me
to
the
office
of
the
police
inspector
of
this
village
?
"
Officer
Lodge
was
rather
taken
aback
.
He
was
in
his
shirtsleeves
,
like
a
common
labourer
,
and
here
was
a
gentleman
,
evidently
a
foreigner
,
in
search
of
the
police
inspector
;
he
was
gratified
at
the
important
title
.
He
took
his
coat
from
the
cart
,
and
slipped
it
on
,
obtruding
its
brass
buttons
on
the
stranger
.
"
but
I'm
the
police
,
at
your
"
There
ain't
exacly
a
hinspector
in
Walton
,
"
he
said
,
with
an
air
of
careless
pomp
"
service
,
sir
.
"
I
am
very
glad
,
"
accurred
in
this
villages
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
gravely
;
"
I
wish
to
make
some
inquiries
about
a
case
of
murder
that
some
years
ago
.
Can
you
assist
me
?
"
"
There
was
only
one
such
.
i
a
case
,
sir
,
"
said
Officer
Lodge
,
the
kindliness
of
his
feminine
heart
speaking
in
his
my
.
side
.
But
a
saddened
tone
,
"
I
know
all
about
it
.
It
was
me
as
arrested
her
;
and
it
was
unwilling
work
on
.
hofficer
must
do
his
duty
,
sir
.
"
"
Can
we
not
sit
down
somewhere
,
and
talk
it
over
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
At
the
inn
,
sir
,
certingly
,
"
replied
Officer
Lodge
,
"
and
a
good
glass
a
'
hale
you
can
'
ave
,
too
,
sir
.
"
They
were
soon
seated
in
a
quiet
little
room
,
and
each
had
his
"
glass
a
'
hale
"
before
him
.
Officer
Lodge
told
the
story
like
a
man
who
had
often
told
it
before
:
all
the
angles
were
rounded
,
and
the
dramatic
points
brought
out
with
melodramatic
emphasis
.
Mr.
Wyville
let
him
run
on
till
he
had
no
more
to
"
And
this
strange
woman
,
who
came
to
the
village
on
the
morning
of
the
murder
,
"
he
said
,
when
he
had
heard
all
;
"
this
woman
who
was
Draper's
first
wife
--
has
she
ever
been
heard
of
since
?
"
"
O
,
Harriet
Draper
,
bless
you
,
yessir
.
"
said
Officer
Lodge
she
comes
back
periodical
,
and
gets
into
quod
-
-
parding
me
,
sir
,
I
mean
into
jail
.
"
"
What
does
she
do
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Well
,
she's
a
bad
'
un
.
We
don't
know
where
she
comes
from
,
;
nor
where
she
goes
to
.
She
drinks
'
cavy
,
and
then
she
goes
down
there
near
Draper's
'
ouse
,
and
the
other
'
ouse
,
an
'
she
kicks
shouting
.
She
does
it
periodical
;
and
we
has
to
lock
her
"
When
was
she
here
last
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
сири
Officer
Lodge
pulled
out
a
leather
-
covered
pass
-
book
,
and
examined
it
.
up
a
muss
of
crying
and
say
:
"
She's
out
of
her
"
lar
border
,
this
time
,
"
he
said
,
"
she
'
aven't
been
'
ere
for
a
year
.
But
I
heard
of
her
later
reg
than
that
in
the
penitentiary
at
Liverpool
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
asked
no
more
questions
.
He
wrote
an
address
on
a
card
,
and
handed
it
to
Officer
Lodge
.
"
If
this
woman
return
here
,
"
he
said
,
"
well
rewarded
.
"
or
if
you
find
out
where
she
is
,
write
to
that
address
,
and
you
shall
be

read
Officer
Lodge
from
the
card
.
"
Yessir
,
I'll
do
it
.
Oh
no
,
none
of
that
,
"
he
said
,
firmly
putting
back
some
offering
in
Mr.
Wyville's
hand
;
"
I'm
in
your
debt
,
sir
,
I
was
a
'
most
going
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
with

I'm
obliged
to
you

I'll
do
this
all

better

of
your

kindness
