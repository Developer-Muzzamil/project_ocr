the

When

passed
through
a
in
day
which
,
now
it
was
over
,
seemed
more
like
a
long
dream
,
though
every
particular
was
engraven
deeply
in
his

;
;
and
he
was
not
sorry
it
was
ended
,
to
judge
by
the
sigh
of
relief
he
gave
,
as
,
closing
the
door
,
he
found
himself
alone
at
last
.
He
opened

window
to

the
gardens

now
in
the
silver
light
of
the
harvest
moon

Upon
the
rugged
grey
stone
of
the
balcony
beneath
its
carvings
standing
out
in
bold
relief
against
the
darker
shades
on
the
turf
,
and
down
the
steps
,
to
the
smooth
lawns
and
flower
beds
of
curious
shapes
,
filled
with
rare
plants
,
and
blooms
of
brilliant
hue
,
all
now
blurred
together
in
an
uncertain
medley
by
the
twilight
.
Here
and
there
,
dotted
about
the
gardens
,
rose
scantily
draped
statues
of
the
same
material
wherewith
the
house
was
built
,
holding
up
marble
basins
,
round
which
ivy
had
wound
itself
,
and
with
the
moon's
rays
falling
upon
them
to
cover
up
their
ruggedness
and
imperfections
,
they
looked
like
living
creatures
,
or
at
least
like
the
shades
of
another
age
-
spectres
of
former
generations
of
Morningtons
,
risen
from
their
graves
to
confront
the
latest
of
their
line
leaning
.
out
of
the
window
.
And
then
,
a
little
farther
,
rows
of
tall
yew
trees
bordered
the
gardens
,
like
a
gigantic
black
palisade
of

which
they
enclosed
;
while
through
them
,
shining
like

with

,
were

lake
extending
along
the
southern
boundary

Pleasant
thoughts
passed
through
Harold
Mornington's
mind
as
he
revelled
in
the
delightful
spectacle
.
Visions
of
happiness
arose
.
He
reckoned
the
many
years
he
still
might
live
,
and
determined
to
enjoy
to
the
utmost
,
now
that
he
had
every
facility
.
He
thrust
from
him
regrets
of
the
past
which
sought
to
vex
him
.
Eva's
face
was
mixed
up
with
all
his
prospects
,
with
that
appealing
look
of
affection
,
which
had
touched
him
most
intimately
,
surcharged
as
it
was
with
a
reminder
of
the
past
.
He
looked
above
at
the
cloudless
sky
glittering
every

sight
though
it
be
which
few
.
contemplate
without
emotion
.
It
brings
to
the
lovers
sentiment
,
to
the
enthusiast
awe
,
and
an
the
scoffer
imposes
reflection
:
On
Harold
Mornington
it
showered
rays
of
ambition
.
The
shooting
stars
seemed
by
their
luminous
paths
to
link
him
with
highmost
things
.
Projects
,
long
torpid
in
a
heart
numbed
by
the
purgatory
of
misery
and
remorse
.
Proud
imaginings
filled
his
brain
,
and
he
pictured
himself
as
a
statesman
,
honoured
and
revered
.
He
remembered
his
triumphs
at
college
debating
societies
;
and
convictions
of
s
f
success
,
based
on
his
great
wealth
and
the
influence
of
his
name
,
took
the
place
of
fancies
.
Glancing
below
,
as
his
eyes
rested
upon
came
the
statues
,
a
strange
thought
him
.
Life
was
on
a
sudden
breathed
into
them
,
and
they
slowly
dilated
into
majestic
proportions
,
each
in
dress
of
bygone
years
,
but
all
with
the
Mornington
features
;
with
one
same
dark
frown
and
a
threatening
upon
finger
pointed
to
him
.
As
if
with
one
voice
came
a
low
whisper
from
all
,
borne
to
his
ears
with
horrible
distinctness
:
"
Thou
wert
thy
brother's
keeper
.
Where
is
the
man
?
"
upon
which
Three
times
,
he
was
assured
,
the
fingers
were
raised
,
and
the
dread
whisper
uttered
,
thereupon
they
returned
to
their
former
shapes
,
and
all
the
vision
faded
away
.
Still
he
leant
forward
spell
-
bound
,
shuddering
;
involuntarily
his
thoughts
went
back
to
scenes
less
fair
:
the
lonely
cabin
in
the
desolate
north
,
indeed
the
stars
shone
even
more
brightly
in
a
clearer
air
,
but
,
as
he
had
seen
it
last
in
midwinter
,
no
picturesque
landscape
.
Snow
everywhere
;
lofty
pines
and
cedars
laden
with
icicles
,
through
which
the
Arctic
gale
pealed
demoniac
chimes
.
The
hut
was
transparent
to
his
searching
gaze
,
so
that
he
beheld
himself
—
in
exact
similitude
-
crouching
over
a
dying
fire
and
beside
a
comrade
whom
he
had
readily
abandoned
at
the
cry
of
Fortune
for
him
to
come
out
of
exile
and
enjoy
tens
of
thousands
.
But
that
hunger
-
bitten
,
despairing
visage
—
was
that
ever
his
?
He
shrank
from
it
and
dashed
down
the
blind
to
shut
out
the
English
view
which
ghastly
a
delusion
.
All
night
through
,
his
sleep
was
perturbed
and
his
brain
busy
with
had
dissolved
into
so
an
interminable
train
of
imaginings
which
ghostly
whispers
suggested
.
The
next
morning
dawned
,
a
truly
autumnal
one
;
a
heavy
mist
spreading
over
the
country
and
brooding
in
soon
gained
the
force
to
roam
,

,

sun

shining
through
it
at
first
like

ball

fire

disperse
.
Mr.
Mornington
,
despite
his
restless
night
,
was
down
early
,
but
was
soon
joined
by
Eva
,
and
as
Mr.
Woodruff
had
had
breakfast
and
gone
out
an
hour
before
,
and
Mrs.
Neville
always
took
hers
in
her
two
were
alone
.
Notwithstanding
her
over
-
1
-night's
determination
,
Eva
was
nervous
,
and
her
greeting
was
shy
although
affectionate
.
She
was
urged
when
she
encountered
her
father's
steady
gaze
,
and
received
his
somewhat
stiff
salute
,
to
rush
upstairs
to
her
room
,
and
give
way
to
the
tears
which
she
had
difficulty
in
repressing
•
She
was
successful
,
however
,
in
overcoming
the
impulse
,
and
sat
through
the
meal
in
quietude
.
Mr.
Mornington
did
not
speak
until
it
was
nearly
over
,
when
he
laid
down
the
newspaper
and
said
with
a
short
laugh
:
"
This
is
all
Greek
to
me
for
the
present
;
I
have
been
away

long
