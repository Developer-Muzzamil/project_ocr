of
a
river
.
He
followed
its
course
for
a
short
distance
,
until
he
reached
a
privet
hedge
.
A
small
wicket
gate
was
easily
unfastened
,
and
admitted
him
to
the
lawn
of
a
private
house
,
half
-
cottage
,
half
-
villa
,
evidently
unoccupied
.
The
gravel
paths
were
thick
with
weeds
,
the
grass
was
long
and
sprinkled
with
daisies
,
the
hedges
were
untrimmed
,
and
the
flower
-
beds
empty
,
whilst
a
staring
placard
in
the
front
window
announced
that
"
This
Desirable
Residence
was
to
be
Let
or
Sold
.
"
Mornington
stood
on
the
path
,
in
the
centre
of
this
desolation
,
now
looking
around
to
mark
its
spread
;
now
up
at
the
house
,
as
if
trying
to
reconcile
the
cheerless
scene
with
dim
memories
of
its
appearance
under
different
auspices
.
The
endeavour
involved
thought-
deep
that
he
became
absorbed
,
leaning
against
the
so
I
arms
and
closed
eyes
.
Pleasant
thoughts
there
might
have
been
,
at
first
,
passing
through
his
ones
.
On
quitting
his
position
,
gate
with
folded
mind
,
to
judge
from
his
softened
expression
,
and
the
slight
smile
.
Soon
came
a
change
,
and
gradually
the
smile
died
away
and
the
hard
lines
came
back
to
his
face
,
which
&
grew
darker
and
darker
,
until
there
settled
there
so
vindictive
an
expression
,
so
fierce
that
a
bystander
(
had
there
been
one
)
,
would
have
easily
surmised
that
the
main
recollections
here
inspired
were
anything
but
pleasant
.
he
walked
down
to
the
water's
edge
,
and
,
standing
on
the
brink
,
viewed
the
river's
course
for
several
minutes
.
Seeing
a
boat
coming
,
he
shrank
away
towards
the
house
,
peering
through
the
windows
into
the
empty
rooms
,
and
trying
the
doors
which
,
however
,
were
all
locked
.
Then
,
with
a
last
lingering
glance
around
,
as
if
he
found
some
fascination
in
the
view
,
and
as
if
it
caused
him
equal
pain
to
leave
the
place
as
he
had
found
in
its
suggestions
,
he
opened
the
gate
and
walked
rapidly
towards
the
village
.
At
the
inn
,
he
ordered
lunch
,
and
asked
to
see
the
landlord
,
who
came
bustling
in
,
a
pleasant
-
looking
.
man
,
disposed
to
make
much
of
a
customer
who
ordered
the
best
lunch
and
wines
the
house
could
afford
.
But
something
in
the
look
of
his
a
patron
warned
him
to
check
at
once
the
flow
of
tittle
-
tattle
which
he
was
commencing
,
and
answer
simply
his
guest's
questions
.
"
You
are
the
landlord
here
,
I
believe
?
"
asked
Mr.
Mornington
,
looking
up
as
he
entered
.
"
At
your
service
,
sir
"
"
"
Can
you
tell
me
the
name
of
the
parish
clerk
here
?
"
"
Surely
,
I
I
can
,
sir
,
although
he
is
a
new
man
.
"
Mr.
Carvel
,
who
was
clerk
here
some
thirty
years
,
died
week
afore
last
,
and
the
new
man's
name
is
Hassop
.
"
"
And
does
this
Mr.
Hassop
live
near
here
?
"
was
the
next
question
.
Very
nigh
,
indeed
,
a'most
next
door
.
'
"
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr.
Mornington
,
reflectively
,
"
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
sending
in
to
him
for
me
?
"
"
Certainly
not
.
What
sir
?
"
message
,
"
Say
that
a
gentleman
here
would
like
particularly
to
speak
to
him
for
a
moment
,
if
he
wouldn't
object
.
"
The
landlord
bowed
and
left
the
room
,
returning
in
a
few
minutes
,
to
usher
in
a
short
fat
man
with
red
face
and
abrupt
t
manner
,
who
bowed
inquiringly
to
Mr.
Mornington
,
whilst
Boniface
beat
a
retreat
with
a
magnificent
assumption
of
not
being
inquisitive
.
"
"
Want
to
speak
to
me
,
sir
?
"
he
said
,
my
name
being
Hassop
.
"
"
How
do
do
you
understand
,
clerk
to
the
parish
?
"
Mr.
Hassop
?
"
said
Mr.
Mornington
,
graciously
.
"
I
must
apologise
for
troubling
you
'
You
I
are
,
The
other
nodded
assent
.
"
"
I
wish
to
consult
your
register
with
regard
to
the
date
of
a
marriage
which
took
place
here
,
many
years
ago
:
"
That's
easy
enough
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
you'll
only
have
to
come
up
to
the
church
with
me
,
and
I'll
show
you
the
book
.
"
"
It
couldn't
be
brought
down
here
?
"
remarked
Mr.
Mornington
,
suggestively
.
"
Quite
imp—
.
"
Mr.
Hassop
halted
here
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
bank
-
note
which
the
other
had
drawn
out
of
his
pocket
-
book
"
The
fact
is
,
"
took
up
Mr.
Mornington
,
"
I'm
very
tired
and
I
have
just
ordered
lunch
,
and
I
don't
care
to
trudge
up
to
the
church
.
Enough
to
bring
.
on
an
attack
of
my
old
enemy
knee
as
if
it
were
an
infallible
plaister
against
the
gout
.
"
here
he
smoothed
out
the
bank
-
nate
an
his
"
Truly
aristocratic
gentleman
this-
-habituated
to
the
gout
,
and
not
one
to
be
enticed
into
the
damp
muniment
-
room
,
"
thought
Mr.
Hassop
.
"
Of
cou
course
,
I
don't
expect
a
parish
official
to
oblige
me
for
nothing
.
Bring
the
register
down
here
,
"
he
continued
,
still
smoothing
out
the
note
,
so
obstinate
were
the
creases
;
a
not
unpleasant
though
aggravating
crackling
from
it
titillating
Mr.
Hassop's
fibres
.
"
And
,
ahem
I
I
may
request
—
and
I
will
ask
you
to
accept
this
as
a
f
feeble
recompense
for
the
trouble
I
am
causing
you
.
"
He
held
up
the
five
-
pound
note
.
