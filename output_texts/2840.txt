She's

Worse
and
worse

But

"
"
Done
for
?
"
"
Ay
,
she'll
go
this
time
,
sir
.
Seven
year
at
the
least
.
She
nearly
killed
a
woman
,
and
she
would
have
killed
her
altogether
if
she'd
had
her
way
a
minute
longer
.
"
"
Tell
me
the
facts
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
Well
,
sir
,
she
were
down
near
Draper's
'
ouse
all
one
day
last
week
,
and
she
hacted
queer
.
They
and
told
me
,
came
for
,
me
and
I
looked
after
her
all
the
hafternoon
.
But
she
were
doing
no
harm
to
nobody
.
She
only
sat
on
the
roadside
,
looking
at
Draper's
'
ouse
.
Towards
evening
she
went
into
Mrs.
Walmsley's
old
'
ouse
,
wich
is
hopen
,
and
she
stayed
there
an
hour
.
Draper's
sister
,
who
was
too
curious
,
maybe
,
went
up
to
the
’
ouse
,
to
see
what
she
were
doing
;
and
then
it
began
.
I
heerd
two
voices
,
one
a
screaming
and
the
tother
swearing
and
when
I
ran
to
the
spot
,
I
sees
Harriet
assaulting
the
woman
,
choking
her
and
beating
her
head
against
the
stones
.
If
I
had
been
half
a
minute
later
,
there
would
have
been
murder
.
'
"
Does
the
prisoner
speak
to
anyone
?
"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
"
No
,
there's
no
one
to
speak
to
her
but
me
;
and
she
never
hopens
her
lips
to
me
.
"
"
Can
I
see
her
,
and
speak
with
her
?
"
"
Yessir
,
"
said
Officer
Lodge
"
but
be
careful
-
she's
not
safe
.
"
Officer
Lodge
carefully
locked
the
outer
door
,
and
then
approached
the
lock
-
up
.
He
knocked
on
the
door
heavily
with
the
key
,
as
if
to
rouse
the
prisoner
.
No
sound
came
from
within
.
He
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
,
and
opened
the
door
.
Mr.
Wyville
entered
the
lock
-
up
,
which
was
a
room
about
twelve
feet
square
,
with
one
window
.
A
wooden
bench
ran
round
three
sides
of
the
room
,
and
in
the
farther
.
comer
,
upan
the
bench
,
was
something
like
a
heap
of
clothes
.
It
was
the
prisoner
,
who
sat
upon
the
bench
,
her
back
to
the
wall
,
her
knees
drawn
up
,
and
her
face
sunk
upon
them
.
A
tattered
shawl
covered
her
,
clothes
.
so
that
she
presented
the
appearance
of
a
heap
of
wretched
for
a
minute
afterwards
.
But
as
someone
had
entered
,
and
the
door
She
did
not
move
as
the
door
opened
,
nor
had
not
been
closed
,
she
became
aware
of
the
intrusion
.
She
raised
her
head
,
and
looked
around
on
the
floor
,
slowly
,
till
her
glance
fell
on
Mr.
Wyville's
feet
.
Then
she
raised
her
She
seemed
to
have
been
in
a
sort
of
daze
or
waking
dream
.
She
did
not
take
her
eyes
away
,
but
looked
at
the
strange
face
before
her
as
if
she
were
not
yet
awake
.
eyes
,
till
they
rested
on
his
face
.
She
was
a
woeful
wreck
of
womanhood
.
Her
had
cavernous
circles
around
them
,
and
her
cheeks
were
eyes
sunken
,
as
if
with
consuming
disease
.
Her
hair
,
unkempt
,
was
covered
with
the
old
shawl
,
but
its
straggling
locks
fell
across
her
forehead
.
As
she
looked
at
Mr.
Wyville
,.
;
some
remnant
of
womanly
feeling
stirred
within
her
,
and
she
raised
a
wasted
hand
and
pressed
backward
the
tangled
hair
from
each
side
of
her
face
.
Wretched
as
she
was
,
and
lost
,
there
was
something
beneath
all
the
stains
that
spoke
of
a
face
and
soft
and
loveable
.

Harriet
Draper

She
moved
uneasily
at
the
name
,
and
her
large
eyes
grew
fearfully
bright
.
'
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
with
unusual
emotion
in
his
deep
voice
,
and
speaking
in
a
subdued
tone
.
"

gasped
the
woman
,
suddenly
burying
her
face
again
,
as
if
she
had
been
stabbed
in
the
breast
.
Then
she
started
,
and
sprang
to
the
floor
,
and
put
her
hands
on
her
eyes
.
"
O
God
!

she
hoarsely
whispered

as

speaking
to
herself

She
took
away
her

and
looked
severely
for
a
moment
at
Mr.
Wyville

He
met

than

Her
voice
became
high
with
excitement

her
eyes
blazed

as
with
frenzy
