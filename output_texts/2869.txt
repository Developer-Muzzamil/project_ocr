said
Sister
Cecilia
,
not
trying
to
detain
her
,
though
the
girls
did
.
"
I
thought
it
would
be
pleasanter

more
natural
to
than

monotonous

life

said
the
words
without

with
tears

said
Sister
Cecilia
,
taking
her
face
between
her
hands
in
the
old
way
;
"
I
am
so
happy
to
hear
you

"
With
characteristic
wisdom
and
kindness
,
Sister
Cecilia
had
obtained
for
Alice
,
shortly
after
their
arrival
,
a
home
in
a
rich
settler's
family
.
Her
mind
,
so
recently
freed
from
the
enforced
vacancy
,
became
instantly
filled
with
new
interests
,
and
her
life
at
once
took
root
in
the
new
country
.

When
she
had
been
settled
so
for
about
a
fortnight
,
and
was
becoming
accustomed
to
the
new
routine
,
she
received
a
letter
from
Will
Sheridan
.
She
knew
it
was
from
him
;
but
she
did
not
the
children
.
When
her
duties
for
the
day
were
done
,
she
walked
down
towards
the
convent
,
which
was
only
half
a
mile
away
;
but
when
she
came
to
the
tall
rocks
beside
the
river
,
where
she
was
utterly
alone
,
she
opened
and
read
her
letter
.
It
was
a
simple
and
direct
note
,
saying
4
"
Good
-
bye
for
a
time
,
"
that
he
was
going
to
Adelaide
to
leave
the
crew
of
the
convict
ship
there
;
but
he
should
call
on
her
,
"
for
the
old
time's
sake
,
"
when
he
returned
.
Alice
read
the
letter
many
times
,
and
between
each
reading
her
eyes
.
rested
on
the
placid
river
.
Once
before
,
she
had
been
haunted
with
the
last
words
of
his
letter
,
"
Yours
faithfully
;
"
and
now
she
repeated
and
repeated
the
one
sentence
that
was
not
prosaic
-
-
"
I
will
come
for
the
old
time's
sake
.
"
"
A
few
weeks
later
she
received
a
letter
from
him
,
written
in
Adelaide
,
telling
her
of
the
voyage
,
and
stating
the
time
of
their
probable
return
to
Fremantle
.
Alice
could
not
help
the
recurring
thought
that
he
was
thinking
of
her
.
One
day
,
at
dinner
,
Mr.
Little
spoke
to
her

said
Alice

quite
heartily
;
and
she
joined
the
conversation
in
his
praise
,
telling
many
incidents
of
