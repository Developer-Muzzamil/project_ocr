his
rug
around
his
position
,
he
kept
staring
out
into
the
blackness
of
the
night
.
He
opened
the
window
then
,
and
leant
out
;
the
rush
of
cold
air
seemed
to
bring
him
relief
,
for
,
closing
it
a
few
minutes
after
,
and
wrapping
.
knees
,
he
settled
down
into
a
fit
of
steady
thought
.
So
engrossed
did
he
become
,
that
his
fresh
cigar
went
out
,
and
slipped
from
his
fingers
.
on
to
the
floor
without
his
appearing
to
notice
it
.
For
hour
after
hour
he
sat
with
eyes
fixed
downwards
,
undisturbed
by
the
flash
of
lights
,
the
shrill
whistle
and
the
increased
oscillation
of
the
train
,
as
with
ever
-
accelerated
speed
,
it
dashed
through
way
stations
without
stopping
.
But
each
time
the
train
slackened
speed
,
he
took
out
his
watch
,
immediately
to
replace
it
with
an
impatient
gesture
.
If
that
vacant
seat
opposite
him
could
have
been
occupied
by
a
painter
or
by
a
physiognomist
,
either
would
have
been
interested
in
their
companion
.
The
former
would
probably
have
made
a
thumbnail
sketch
of
the
hard
mouth
,
dark
expression
,
knitted
brows
,
and
haunted
,
mournful
expression
of
the
.
and
probably
if
he
were
to
picture
an
unhappy
!
man
,
these
traits
would
have
reappeared
;
and
,
if
correctly
reproduced
,
would
I
as
a
correct
embodiment
of
profound
misery
.
have
been
recognised
eyes
The
physiognomist
would
have
studied
with
more
sympathy
perhaps
,
-
-the
sympathy
which
a
sincere
student
of
human
nature
always
bestow's
upon
his
subject
;
but
he
would
,
nevertheless
,
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
as
the
artist
,
The
study
would
have
been
an
interesting
one
.
for
he
would
not
be
slow
to
detect
great
force
of
character
,
as
well
as
intellect
,
in
those
firm
,
well
-
cut
features
and
lowering
forehead
.
And
he
would
no
doubt
,
wonder
what
curse
was
blighting
and
embittering
the
life
beneath
that
mask
,
wearing
such
traces
of
grief
.
He
would
have
observed
that
these
were
not
the
traces
of
such
sorrow
as
the
death
of
a
relation
,
however
dear
,
could
impose
.
They
presented
evidences
of
a
living
grief
,.
some
terrible
secret
,
some
stinging
premorse
ever
present
,
and
not
a
sorrow
that
graves
.
enclose
.
These
watchers
would
,
no
entertain
no
little
curiosity
whether
they
were
travelling
with
a
criminal
or
with
a
victim
of
peculiarly
adverse
circumstances
.
But
they
would
feel
that
,
even
had
they
been
the
greatest
friends
of
the
vis
-
`
-
vis
who
interested
them
,
they
would
have
but
little
chance
of
learning
his
history
;
it
was
clearly
part
of
the
nature
of
this
man
to
crave
for
no
sympathy
or
friendship
,
to
suffer
in
silence
,
and
to
carry
to
the
end
unrevealed
,
the
melancholy
secret
which
super
-
saturated
his
life
.
can
doubt
For
the
last
time
,
Mr.
Mornington
took
out
his
watch
,
and
observing
by
the
lights
stretching
far
an
either
side
,
and
by
the
slackening
of
the
train
,
that
they
were
approaching
a
large
town
,
made
preparations
to
alight
.
When
he
stepped
upon
the
platform
he
inquired
at
once
for
the
means
.
of
reaching
King's
Morton
,
a
small
town
on
a
branch
line
.
There
was
no
train
until
late
in
the
morning
,
which
had
already
commenced
to
dawn
,
and
vexedly
he
suffered
himself
to
be
directed
to
the
hotel
,
where
he
slept
from
sheer
weariness
for
a
few
hours
.
In
the
morning
his
restlessness
returned
,
amounting
to
a
feverish
anxiety
to
be
moving
;
and
he
was
on
the
platform
of
the
station
waiting
for
the
local
train
,
half
an
hour
before
it
was
timed
to
depart
.
Once
in
the
train
,
however
,
and
commencing
the
final
stage
of
his
journey
,
the
fretfulness
apparently
passed
off
,
unless
its
only
remaining
evidences
were
his
trembling
hands
and
eager
eyes
..
In
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
"
King's
crys
and
our
traveller
alighted
.
As
he
had
left
his
luggage
at
the
hotel
where
he
had
slept
,
he
walked
undelayed
through
the
station
,
and
,
with
the
air
of
I
one
to
whom
the
place
was
familiar
,
turned
down
the
road
towards
the
little
town
.
Morton
!
"
was
the
King's
Morton
was
one
of
those
old
-
fashioned
village
-
towns
,
now
still
more
and
more
scarce
,
but
a
few
still
exist
in
England
,
where
the
feverish
excitement
of
larger
towns
is
altogether
unfelt
.
The
railroad
which
connected
it
with
the
main
line
had
only
recently
been
opened
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
irresistible
arm
of
Progress
had
passed
over
,
touching
it
lightly
,
and
leaving
its
old
institutions
and
manners
still
flourishing
and
uninfluenced
with
the
spirit
of
enterprise
and
the
money
-
fever
,
transforming
so
many
of
these
erst
picturesque
old
villages
,
into
smoky
manufacturing
towns
.
Here
son
succeeded
father
in
seldom
interrupted
line
,
and
most
of
the
inhabitants
could
trace
back
to
forefathers
who
had
held
the
posts
now
their
own
.
At
first
sight
you
i
would
probably
deem
King's
Morton
a
sleepy
,
do
-
nothing
sort
of
a
place
;
but
no
!
the
people
thrived
well
in
their
occupations
,
having
no
undue
and
disproportionate
competition
.
Poverty
was
,
indeed
,
a
rare
thing
amongst
them
,
as
also
was
wealth
.
There
was
no
craving
for
the
latter
,
which
,
perhaps
,
is
sufficient
to
account
,
in
a
measure
,
for
the
absence
of
the
former
.
The
people
are
strictly
Conservative
,
and
averse
to
strangers
,
and
they
looked
curiously
after
Mr.
Mornington
,
marvelling
what
could
bring
so
distinguished
-
looking
a
visitor
to
their
little
town
.
And
yet
,
he
did
not
appear
to
be
altogether
a
stranger
.
He
looked
in
at
the
blacksmith's
shed
,
as
if
he
half
expected
to
see
some
gentleman
there
,
awaiting
the
replacement
of
a
cast
shoe
;
he
glanced
up
at
the
old
town
clock
which
ruled
the
hours
,
with
the
air
of
one
accustomed
to
govern
his
comings
and
goings
by
its
somewhat
erratic
course
;
and
he
nodded
involuntarily
to
the
old
watchmaker
who
stood
outside
his
shop
.
His
hesitating
response
and
puzzled
mien
,
betrayed
I
no
previous
acquaintance
.
Besides
,
he
cast
frequent
glances
around
him
,
not
as
one
who
