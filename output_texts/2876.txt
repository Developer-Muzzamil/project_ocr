recalled
to
his
mind
the
figure
of
the
unhappy
Harriet
,
as
he
had
seen
her
in
the
lock
-
up
of
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
.
Something
induced
him
to
look
at
the
woman
a
second
time
.
As
he
did
so
,
she
raised
her
face
,
and
smiled
at
a
man
who
came
quickly
out
of
the
bank
,
pressing
something
like
a
heavy
pocket
-
book
into
his
breast
.
The
woman
was
Harriet
,
and
the
man
was
Draper
,
who
had
just
drawn
her
money
from
the
bank
.

When
about
half
way
to
Mr.
Wyville
was
in
no
mood
to
ride
swiftly
,
so
he
let
his
horse
choose
its
own
pace
.
"
Perth
,
however
,
he
broke
into
a
canter
,
and
arrived
shortly
after
the
trap
containing
Ben
Lodge
and
his
native
servant
.
Mr.
Wyville
had
not
occupied
the
official
residence
of
the
Comptroller
-
General
,
but
had
kept
his
quarters
at
the
hotel
,
a
very
comfortable
establishment
.
As
he
dismounted
in
the
yard
,
Ben
Lodge
held
his
horse
,
and
seemed
in
garrulous
humour
.
"
Mr.
Sheridan
were
here
,
sir
,
"
said
Ben
,
"
and
he
asked
after
you
!
He
said
he
were
going
to
Mr.
Little's
to
-
1
and
he
hoped
to
see
!
you
there
.
"
a
-
night
,
Mr.
Wyville
nodded
to
Ben
,
and
was
going
towards
the
house
;
but
Officer
Lodge
looked
at
him
with
a
knowing
look
in
his
simple
face
,
as
if
enjoying
.
"
He's
found
her
at
last
,
sir
,
"
he
said
.
some
secret
pleasure
.
Mr.
Wyville
could
only
smile
at
the
remark
,
which
he
did
not
at
all
comprehend
.
a
boy
.
"
He
were
always
fond
of
her
.
I've
known
him
since
he
were
a
l
Still
Mr.
Wyville
did
not
speak
;
but
he
seemed
interested
,
and
he
ceased
to
smile
.
Old
Ben
saw
that
he
might
continue
.
"
I
thought
at
one
time
that
they'd
be
married
.
It's
years
ago
;
but
I
see
them
as
plain
as
if
it
were
yesterday
.
He
were
a
handsome
fellow
when
he
came
home
from
sea
--
just
like
his
father
,
old
Captain
Sheridan-
-
I
knew
him
well
,
too
--
and
just
to
think
!
"
Here
Old
Ben
stopped
,
and
led
the
horse
towards
the
stable
,
satisfied
with
his
own
eloquence
.
Mr.
Wyville
stood
just
where
he
had
dismounted
.
He
looked
after
Ben
Lodge
,
then
walked
towards
the
hotel
,
but
he
changed
his
mind
,
and
returned
and
entered
the
stable
,
where
Ben
was
unsaddling
the
horse
.
"
Was
Mr.
Sheridan
alone
when
he
started
for
Mr.
Little's
?
"
he
asked
.
"
Yessir
,
he
were
alone
.
"
Then
Ben
added
with
a
repetition
of
the
knowing
look
:
"
Happen
,
he
don't
want
no
company
,
sir
;
he
never
did
when
he
were
a
boy
,
when
she
was
'
round
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
looked
at
Ben
Lodge
in
such
a
way
that
the
old
man
would
have
been
frightened
had
he
raised
his
head
.
There
was
a
sternness
of
brow
rarelys
y
seen
on
the
calm
,
strong
face
,
and
there
was
a
light
almost
of
terror
in
the
eye
"
He
were
very
fond
of
Alice
,
surely
,
"
said
the
old
fellow
,
as
he
went
on
with
his
work
;
"
and
I
do
believe
he's
"
just
as
fond
of
her
to
-
day
.
"
"
Do
you
1
tell
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
slowly
,
"
that
Mr.
Sheridan
knew
Miss
Walmsley
,
very
intimately
,
in
Walton-
le
-
Dale
,
years
ago
?
"
"
Ohâ‚‚
4
yessir
;
they
was
very
hintimate
,
no
doubt
;
and
they
were
going
to
be
married
,
folk
said
,
when
that
precious
rascal
,
Draper
,
interfered
.
They
say
in
Walton
to
this
day
that
he
turned
her
head
by
lies
.
against
man
she
loved
.
"
the
Ben
Lodge
carried
the
saddle
to
another
part
of
the
yard
.
Had
he
looked
round
he
would
have
seen
?
Wyville
leaning
against
the
stall
,
his
face
changed
by
mental
suffering
almost
past
recognition
.
In
a
minute
,
when
the
old
man
returned
,
Mr.
Wyville
passed
him
in
silence
,
and
entered
the
hotel
.
Mr.
The
door
of
his
room
was
locked
for
hours
that
day
,
and
he
sat
beside
his
desk
,
sometimes
with
his
head
erect
,
and
a
blank
suffering
look
in
his
eyes
,
and
sometimes
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
.
The
agony
through
which
his
soul
was
passing
was
almost
mortal
.
The
powerful
nature
was
ploughed
to
its
depths
.
He
saw
the
truth
before
him
,
as
hard
and
palpable
a
granite
rock
.
He
saw
his
own
blind
error
.
His
heart
,
breaking
from
his
will
,
tried
to
travel
again
the
paths
of
sweet
delusion
which
had
brought
so
great
and
new
a
joy
to
his
soul
.
But
the
strong
will
resisted
,
wrestled
,
refused
to
listen
to
the
heart's
cry
of
pain
--
and
,
in
the
end
,
conquered
.
as
a
But
the
man
had
suffered
woefully
in
the
struggle
.
The
lines
on
his
bronzed
face
were
manifestly
deeper
,
and
the
lips
were
firmer
set
,
as
,
towards
evening
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
looked
outwards
and
upwards
at
the
beautiful
deep
sky
.
His
lips
moved
as
he
looked
,
repeating
the
bitter
words
that
were
becoming
sweet
to
his
heart
--
'
Thy
will
be
done
!
'
Two
hours
later
,
when
the
glory
of
the
sunset
had
departed
,
and
the
white
moon
was
reflected
in
the
mirror
-
like
Swan
,
Will
Sheridan
and
Alice
stood
beside
the
river
.
With
one
hand
he
held
ane
of
hers
,
and
the
other
arm
was
around
her
.
He
was
looking
down
into
her
that
were
as
deep
and
calm
as
eyes
the
river
.
