instead
of
being
fixed
on
Mr.
Wyville
,
passed
on
to
Hamerton
,
and
rested
.
"
You
are
not
coming
with
us
to
the
Vasse
!
"
at
length
said
Tapairu
,
in
a
slow
,
monotonous
voice
.
"
You
will
remain
here
.
"
"
No

I

too

even

you

"
Why
does
not
your
brother
and
ours
go
on
the
other
ship
,
and
let
you
with
us
?
come
Mr.
Wyville
looked
troubled
at
the
reception
of
his
news
by
the
sisters
.
As
Tapairu
spoke
,
in
the
last
question
,
his
face
became
exceedingly
grave
,
as
if
he
could
never
again
smile
.
The
sisters
saw
the
shadow
,
and
were
troubled
also
.
Mr.
Wyville
,
without
looking
at
them
,
spoke
--
you
"
Children
,
should
trust
that
I
will
do
what
is
best
;
and
I
know
the
world
better
than
you
Tapairu
,
I
am
acting
wisely
.
Kora
I
am
sure
of
your
confidence
at
least
.
"
Before
the
words
had
died
,
Koro
,
with
swimming
eyes
,
had
risen
and
taken
Mr.
Wyville's
hand
,
which
she
kissed
and
placed
upon
her
head
.
The
act
was
full
of
affection
and
faith
.
Tapairu
on
whom
the
reproof
had
fallen
like
a
blow
,
sat
just
as
before
,
only
the
light
had
faded
from
her
eyes
,
and
her
bosom
heaved
visibly
.
Her
sister
went
and
sat
beside
her
,
throwing
her
arms
round
her
,
as
to
give
comfort
.
Tapairu
allowed
the
embrace
,
but
did
not
move
a
muscle
of
face
or
body
.
Mr.
Wyville
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
,
glanced

I
out
for
a
moment
,
then
,
turning
,
looked
at
the
sisters
.
He
approached
and
laid
his
band
with
inexpressible
gentleness
on
Tapairu's
head
,
as
he
had
done
on
Kara's
The
proud
but
sensitive
nature
yielded
at
the
touch
,
and
with
one
quick
look
of
sorrow
and
appeal
,
she
buried
her
face
in
her
sister's
bosom
,
and
sobbed
unrestrainedly
.
The
old
woman
,
who

,
began
.
an
excited
and
guttural
remonstrance
against
this
unreasoning
grief
.
Mr.
Wyville
chose
this
moment
to
depart
.
He
knew
that
the
brief

season

of
cloud
would
soon
pass
,
and
let
the
sun
shine
again

that

for

previous
