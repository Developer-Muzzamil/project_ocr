verdict
,
and
laughed

actually
laughed
at
the
look
of
horror
in
Cecil's
face
.
Gradually
his
self-
possession
came
back
,
and
he
spoke
again
rapidly
.
We
must

he
said
.
'
Quick

the
balcony
;

he
opened
the
window

out

He
was

moment

,

"
We
kept
only
two
servants
then
,
beside
a
coachman
,
who
did
not
sleep
in
the
house
,
and
of
these
two
,
one
,
had

I
remember
,
asked
that
morning

'
Cecil
whispered
.
I
took
out
a
long
black
case
in
which
I
carried
valuable
sum
of
money
,
and
stuffed
it
into
my
papers
and
had
&
breast

.
Then
we
turned
down
the
gas
,
and
I
followed
Cecil
out
on
the
balcony
,
from
which
we
easily
swung
ourselves
down
to
the
ground
.
We
walked
rapidly
along
,
until
We
came
across
a
stray
hansom
,
and
then
drove
to
Waterloo
station
,
where
we
just
caught
the
special
train
to
Southampton
,
meeting
the
steamship
for
New
York
.
On
this
we
embarked
,
having
procured
a
hasty
outfit
at
a
ready

made

shop
at
the
port
.

The
last
few
years
we
spent
in
the
most
unexplored
part
of
Alaska
,
where
Cecil
Braithwaite
died
.
By
the
merest
accident
,
when
I
had
wandered
as
far
as
the
nearest
settlement
,
an
English
newspaper
fell
into
.
hands
,
and
I
read
the
my
confession
of
a
burglar
named
James
Dalton
,
and
learnt
that
the
warrant
against
,
me
was
cancelled
.
My
and
it
was
months
before
I
reached
Quebec
.
Here
I
called
on
an
English
clergyman

who
lent
me
the

money

You

the

"
Mr.
Mornington
,
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
completed
a
disagreeable
necessity
,
leant
back
in
his
chair
,
and
proceeded
to
re
-
light
his
dead
cigar
.
There
was
a
troubled
look
in
the
lawyer's
face
when
the
story
ceased
,
and
it
was
several
moments
before
he
spoke
.
"
No
one
can
help
feeling
for
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
your
life
n
Cremorse
,
and
with
the
ever
present
fear
of
detection
before

When
did
you
first
hear
that
must
have
been
a
miserable
one
,
crushed
with
such
a
heavy
weight
of
the
murdered
man
was
truly
your
wife's
brother
?
"
"
I
was
then
in
Quebec
,
"
answered
the
other
;
passage
an
English
newspaper
gave
full
particulars
of
the
whole
affair
.
I
had
never
dreamt
of
the
existence
of
any
other
member
of
her
family
;
in
fact
,
she
gave
me
to
understand
that
she
was
an
only
child
.
In
that
paper
I
read
his
history
.
How
he
had
run
away
from
home
after
a
desperate
quarrel
with
his
father
,
enlisted
as
a
private
soldier
and
been
drafted
to
India
;
finally
deserting
,
he
worked
his
back
to
England
,
for
which
,
of
course
,
he
was
liable
to
punishment
.
And
how
he
was
skulking
about
London
when
he
met
his
sister
Eva
,
who
in
fear
of
my
handing
him
over
to
justice
,
never
trusted
me
with
her
secret
,
but
resorted
to
such
ill
-
advised
ways
of
meeting
him
.
I
remember
now
,
her
asking
.
me
one
morning
at
breakfast
,
what
I
should
think
of
a
a
man
who
had
deserted
his
flag
;
and
I
answered
her
that
if
my
own
brother
were
to
desert
,
having
once
joined
the
army
of
his
own
free
will
,
I
would
surrender
him
over
to
the
law
without
hesitation
.
She
shuddered
,
but
I
thought
her
pity
proceeded
from
s
some
case
that
she
was
reading
in
the
paper
;
and
asked
no
questions
.
"
"
Breaking
the
long
silence
,
Mr.
Mornington
spoke
again
.
:
"
How
long
did
my
wife
live
after
Godfrey
and
Eva
were
born
?
"
"
Miss
Eva
and
Mr.
Godfrey
were
born
on
the
23rd
of
December
,
exactly
a
month
after
you
left
England
,
"
he
"
!
replied
;
"
and
Mrs.
Mornington
died
about
six
months
afterwards
,
towards
the
end
of
June
.
She
died
asking
for
you
,
"
he
added
;
but
Mr.
Mornington
displayed
no
token
of
feeling
.
"
Did
she
ever
mention
my
friend's
name
,
Cecil
Braithwaite's
?
"
he
asked
finally
.
"
Never
to
my
knowledge
,
"
was
the
reply
;
the
lawyer
wondering
at
the
interest
his
host
evinced
.
Another
silence
;
this
time
broken
by
the
legal
gentleman
.
There
was
a
troubled
look
on
his
face
,
and
agitation
in
his
tone
.
"
You
must
forgive
me
,
sir
,
if
I
don't
appear
very
sympathising
,
"
he
said
.
"
The
fact
is
I
can
think
of
nothing
else
just
now
but
the
consequences
of
what
i
have
told
me
upon
Miss
Eva
and
Mr.
Godfrey
.
Bad
enough
for
the
young
lady
;
it
will
kill
Mr.
Godfrey
outright
.
He
has
always
been
so
proud
of
his
name
and
descent
—
a
you
thorough
Mornington
.
For
him
to
learn
that
he
has
no
right
to
the
name
he
bears
and
loves
so
well
,
to
find
that
the
law
,
he
is
nameless
—
ah
!
'
twill
be
a
cruel
blow
,
sir
.
"
He
broke
off
almost
in
anger
.
eyes
of
"
Who
will
tell
them
this
,
"
he
added
;
"
and
when
?
"
in
the
men
and
Mr.
Mornington
was
gazing
idly
aloof
,
with
a
faraway
look
.
No
traces
of
the
emotion
which
animated
the
lawyer
were
evident
in
his
manner
,
but
then
he
was
a
man
,
if
of
deep
passions
,
of
a
wonderful
restraint
too
;
and
Mr.
Woodruff
knowing
this
to
be
one
of
the
Mornington
traits
did
not
wonder
.
"
Mr.
Woodruff
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
"
I
propose
our
adjourning
into
the
library
.
The
air
is
getting
chilly
,
and
it
is
already
past
the
time
at
which
you
told
me
Eva
would
arrive
.
Let
us
postpone
this
conversation
.
I
shall
not
