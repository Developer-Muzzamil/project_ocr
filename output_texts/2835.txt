Cecilia
dropped
the
subject
,
and
never
returned
to
it
again
.
From
that
day
she
treated
Alice
Walmsley
in
another
manner
than
of
old
.
She
spoke
with
her
of
all
the
crosses
that
came
in
her
path
,
either
to
herself
or
others
.
By
this
means
the
latent
sympathies
of
Alice
were
touched
and
exercised
.
She
entered
with
interest
into
every
story
of
the
sorrow
or
suffering
of
the
unfortunate
,
related
to
her
by
the
kind
little
Sister
.
In

communion
,

that
her
youth
had

,
too

too

,
even
to

.
That
bright
girlhood
was
the
rich
fallow
ground
.
The
five
dark
years
of
her
and
unbelief
were
the
season
ploughing
and
harrowing
the
fertile
soil
and
sowing
the
fruitful
seed

The
four

of

life
,
during

shoots

womanhood

Towards

of

four
years
a

to

of

quiet
days
within

cell
that

without

,

seeking

nights
within

by
the
magnetism
of

,

himself
beneath
the
gloomy
walls
of
Millbank
,
round
which
he
wandered
through

night
,
and
which
he
could
not
leave
until
he
had
pressed
his
feverish
lips
against
the
icy
stone
of
the
prison
.
On
the
day

when
William
Sheridan
at
last
stood
before
the
door
of
Alice
Walmsley's
cell
,
and
read
her
beloved
name
on
the
card
,
she
sat
within
,
patiently
sewing
the
coarse
cloth
of
her
transport
dress
.
When
the
door
opened

and
his
yearning
sight
was
blessed
with
that
which

she
stood
before

calm
and

and

,
with

,
according
to

modesty
and

COMMITTEE

Mr.
Sheridan
is
to
go
before
the
Committee
to

day
,
is
he
not
?
"
asked
Lord
Somers
,
the
Colonial
Secretarys
as
he
sat
writing
in
Mr.
Wyville's
study
,
with
Sheridan
reading
the
Times
by
the
window
,
and
Hamerton
lounging
in
an
easy-
-chair
.
"
What
Committee
?
"
asked
Hamerton
,
heedlessly
.
"
The
Committee
appointed
to
hear
Sir
Joshua
Hobb's
argument
against
our
Penal
Bill
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
he
continued
to
write
.
"
Does
Sheridan
know
anything
about
prisons
?
"
drawled
Hamerton
.
"
He
know's
something
about
Australia
and
the
men
we
send
there
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
"
Well
--
Hobb
doesn't
.
Hobb
is
a
humbug
.
What
does
he
want
?
"
as
"
To
control
the
Australian
Penal
System
from
Parliament
Street
,
and
,
instead
of
Mr.
Wyville's
humane
bill
,
to
apply
his
own
system
to
the
penal
colony
.
"
"
What
do
you
i
think
of
that
,
Mr.
Sheridan
?
"
asked
Hamerton
,
without
raising
his
head
from
the
cushion
.
That
it
would
be
folly
before
Mr.
Wyville's
bill
was
drawn
--
and
criminal
afterwards
.
"
"
Bravo
!
"
said
Hamerton
,
sitting
straight
;
"
bravo
,
Australia
!
Go
before
the
Committee
,
by
all
means
,
and
talk
just
in
that
tone
.
When
do
they
sit
?

In

hour

said
Lord
Somers
.

the
merits
of

freely

Somers
