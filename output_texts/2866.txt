when
he
had
taken
his
observations
.
"
Have
you
ever
landed
at
Fremantle
?
"
"
Yes
,
ance
--
many
years
ago
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
and
he
crossed
the
deck
to
observe
something
in
the
sea
Throughout
the
voyage
,
neither
Sheridan
nor
Wyville
had
seen
Alice
Walmsley
.
Each
in
his
own
mind
deemed
it
best
to
leave
her
undisturbed
with
Sister
Cecilia
.
Mr.
Wyville
was
still
impressed
with
the
conviction
of
Sheridan's
unhappy
and
hopeless
affection
for
Harriet
;
but
he
was
much
perplexed
by
her
forgetfulness
of
his
name
.
However
,
when
they
reached
Australia
,
one
day
ashore
would
clear
up
matters
without
the
pain
of
preliminary
explanation
.

Day
after
day
,
in
the
mild
southern
air
,
the
ship
glided
slowly
on
,
and
still
the
watchers
on
the
crowded
deck
Sign
of
land
.
From
morning
light
they
leant
on
the
rail
,
looking
away
over
the
smooth
sea
to
where
the
air
was
yellow
with
heat
above
the
unseen
continent
.
There
was
a
warmth
and
pleasure
in
the
promise
it
gave
.
The
straining
eyes
were
saved
the
long
pain
of
watching
the
indistinct
line
.
The
shore
of
West
Australia
is
quite
low
,
and
the
first
sign
of
land
are
tall
mahogany
trees
in
the
bush
.
The
ship
passed
this
first
sight
-
line
early
in
the
night
;
and
next
morning
,
when
the
convicts
were
allowed
on
deck
,
they
saw
,
only
a
few
miles
distant
,
the
white
sand
and
dark
woods
of
their
land
of
bondage
and
promise
.
men
sea
and
land
The
sea
was
as
smooth
as
a
lake
,
and
the
light
air
impelled
the
ship
slowly
.
At
noon
they
passed
within
a
stone's
throw
of
the
island
of
Rottenest
,
and
every
eye
witnessed
the
strange
sight
of
gangs
of
naked
black
working
like
beavers
in
the
sand
,
the
island
being
used
as
a
a
place
of
punishment
for
refractory
natives
.
An
hour
later
,
the
ship
had
approached
within
a
mile
of
the
pier
at
Fremantle
.
The
surrounding
.
were
very
strange
and
beautiful
.
The
green
shoal
-
water
,
the
soft
air
,
with
a
yellowish
warmth
,
the
pure
white
sand
of
the
beach
,
and
the
dark
green
of
the
unbroken
forest
beyond
,
made
a
scene
almost
like
fairyland
.
But
there
was
a
stern
reminder
of
reality
in
the
little
town
of
Fremantle
that
lay
between
the
forest
and
the
sea
.
It
was
built
of
wooden
houses
,
running
down
a
gentle
hill
;
and
in
the
centre
of
the
houses
,
spread
out
like
a
gigantic
star
-
fish
,
was
a
vast
stone
prison
.
There
was
a
moment
of
bustle
and
noise
on
the
deck
,
through
which
.
rang
the
clear
commanding
voice
of
Sheridan
,
and
next
moment
the
anchor
plunged
into
the
sea
and
the
cable
roared
through
the
hawse
-
hole
.
Every
soul
on
board
took
a
long
breath
of
relief
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
.
A
tug
was
seen
coming
from
the
wharf
,
the
deck
of
which
was
crowded
.
At
its
mast
-
head
floated
the
Governor's
flag
.
On
the
deck
was
the
Governor
of
the
colony
with
his
staff
,
and
a
host
of
convict
officers
from
the
prison
.
The
tug
steamed
alongside
,
and
the
Governor
came
on
board
the
convict
ship
.
He
wore
a
blue
tunic
,
with
epaulettes
like
a
naval
officer
,
white
trousers
,
and
a
cocked
hat
.
He
greeted
Mr.
Wyville
with
official
welcome
on
account
of
his
position
,
and
warmly
expressed
his
admiration
of
his
philanthropy
.
"
I
understand
you
bring

"
¡

new
penal
system
,
"
said
the
Governor
.
"
I
hope
it
is
a
stronger
one
than
that
we
"
It
certainly
is
stronger
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
for
it
is
milder
and
juster
.
"
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
the
Governor
,
who
was
a
testy
old
general
,
"
I
hope
you
won't
spoil
them
.
They
need
a
stiff
hand
.
Now
,
I
suppose
you
order
them
on
board
?
"
i
want
those
warders
from
the
prison
to
get
your
crowd
into
order
for

Shall

Mr.
Wyville
had
been
looking
down
on
the
tugs
observing
the
officers
,
who
were
a
rough

one

or
whips
as
well
as
a
pistol
in
the
belt
,
and
a

.
He
turned
with
a
grave
face
to
the
"
Your
Excellency
,
I
am
sure
,
;
will
see
the
wisdom
of
beginning
with
our
new
code
at
once
.
We
have
here
the
best
opportunity
to
emphasize
its
first
principles
.
Shall
I
proceed
?
"
"
By
all

means
,
¿
Sir
;
you
have
absolute
control
of
your
department
.
I
shall
watch
your
method
with
interest
.
"
At
his
order
,
the
warders
boarded
the
ship
,
formed
in
line
,
and
saluted
.
Mr.
Wyville
descended
from
the
poop
,
and
carefully
inspected
them
as
they
stood
in
rank
.
"
Go
to
the
steward
,
"
he
said
to
the
chief
warder
,
as
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
line
,
"
and
;
d
get
from
him
a
large
basket
.
"
The
man
was
astonished
,
but
he
promptly
obeyed
.
In
a
minute
he
returned
with
a
capacious
hamper
.
"
Begin
on
the
right
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
in
curt
tones
,
"
and
place
in
that
hamper
your
pistols
,
swords
,
canes
,
and
whips
.
"
The
warders
scarcely
believed
their
ears
,
but
they
obeyed
.
"
Now
listen
!
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
and
his
voice
thrilled
the
warders
with
its
depth
and
earnestness
.
"
I
am
read
for
you
the
new
law
of
this
colony
,
of
which
you
are
going
to
the
officers
.
Its
first
word
is
,
that
if
any
of
you
strike
or
maltreat
a
prisoner
,
you
shall
be
arrested
,
discharged
,
and
imprisoned
.
