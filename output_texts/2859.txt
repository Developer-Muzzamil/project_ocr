slake
the
parching
thirst
.
Two
pints
of
water
a
day
were
served
out
to
each
convict
-
-
a
quart
of
half
-
putrid
and
blood
-
warm
liquid
.
It
was
a
woeful
sight
to
see
the
thirsty
souls
devour
this
allowance
as
soon
as
their
hot
hands
seized
the
vessel
.
Day
i
y
in
and
day
out
,
the
terrible
calm
held
the
ship
,
and
the
consuming
heat
sapped
the
lives
of
the
pent
-
up
convicts
.
They
suffered
in
strange
patience
.
The
hold
was
silent
all
day
.
They
made
no
complaints
.
When
the
officers
passed
among
them
,
and
spoke
to
them
,
they
smiled
and
sat
still
on
their
berths
.
Only
ance
,
there
was
a
sound
of
discontent
;
when
the
order
was
given
that
the
daily
allowance
of
water
be
reduced
to
one
pint
.
Among
the
officers
of
the
ship
,
there
was
silence
also
.
They
knew
they
were
in
a
latitude
where
calms
lasted
for
long
periods
.
They
flushed
the
decks
with
water
constantly
,
to
try
and
keep
them
cool
,
for
the
sake
of
the
prisoners
below
.
"
We
shall
need
fresh
water
in
a
week
,
"
said
Captain
Draper
to
Mr.
Wyville
one
day
;
"
the
tanks
are
low
already
;
and
evaporation
rapidly
increases
.
"
Mr.
Wyville
did
not
answer
,
except
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
.
Words
were
useless
.
"
Where
is
the
nearest
land
?
"
he
asked
Sheridan
that
afternoon
,
as
they
paced
the
poop
.
"
The
island
of
Principe
is
about
200
miles
to
the
south
,
"
said
Sheridan
.
"
There
is
good
water
there
.
"
The
thought
in
Mr.
Wyville's
mind
never
came
to
words
.
As
Sheridan
spoke
,
he
stopped
suddenly
,
looking
away
to
the
north
,
and
pointing
his
hand
with
an
eager
face
.
A
dark
line
,
very
faint
,
was
moving
.
the
glassy
ocean
.
"
Thank
heaven
!
"
he
said
,
"
yonder
comes
the
breeze
.
"
on
the
face
of
In
half
an
hour
it
fanned
their
faces
,
but
so
gently
that
still
the
sails
hung
useless
,
and
the
pennant
only
stirred
an
inch
from
the
mast
.
But
it
was
a
breath
-
-
it
was
a
drink
.
When
the
night
fell
,
the
breeze
strengthened
,
and
the
ship
moved
.
There
was
no
sleep
on
board
that
night
.
The
hearts
of
all
were
filled
with
deep
relief
and
gratitude
.
The
breeze
held
for
four
days
,
growing
steadier
as
they
sailed
.
On
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
,
aloft
cried
out
,
"
Land
ho
!
"
They
had
sighted
Principe
.
From
deck
,
the
land
was
not
seen
for
a
man
an
hour
later
,
and
the
Houguemont
stood
off
eager
and
on
till
morning
,
when
boats
would
be
sent
ashore
for
water
.
At
the
first
flush
of
dawn
the
ship
was
steered
towards
the
island
.
A
fog
lay
close
to
the
water
,
and
the
eyes
of
the
voyagers
only
saw
a
line
of
wooded
mountain
,
the
base
and
summit
of
which
were
rolled
in
mist
.
The
Houguemont
sailed
into
the

bank
;
and
before
those
on
board
had
time
to
realize
the
change
,
her
foresails
caught
the
sunshine
,
and
she
swung
to
within
a
land
-
locked
harbour
as
beautiful
as
as
a
dream
of
Paradise
.
The
water
broke
against
the
wooded
shores
all
round
the
lovely
haven
.
The
hills
were
covered
with
trees
to
the
top
,
and
the
cocoa
palms
crowded
their
lower
slopes
to
the
very
shore
.
At
the
end
of
the
harbour
stood
the
little
town
of
St.
Antonio
.
The
Houguemont
came
to
anchor
,
and
boats
were
sent
ashore
to
fill
the
water
-
casks
.
The
Swift

clear
streams
were
seen
running
into
the
beautiful
basin
of
the

was

Sheridan
,
who
had
been
watching
the
boat
;
"

fever
!
"
"

Word
,
the
boat's
course
was
changed
,
and
she
returned
to
the
town
.
The
crew
of
the
Houguemont
needed
no
incentive
to
work
.
By
ten
o'clock
that
night
the
casks
were
filled
and
the
ship
was
under

"
A

escape
!
"
said
the
medical
officer
to
Sheridan
,

did
not

,
but

changed

and

blowing

the
beautiful

was
out

and
said
there
was
a
prisoner
very
ill

who
complained
of
nausea
and
pains
in
the
head
and
shoulders
.
The
doctor's
face
grew
pale
at
the
word
;
but
he
turned
away
from
the
warder
.
"
Take
that
man
on
deck
at
once
,
"
he
said
,
quietly
,
"
and
place
him
in

punishment

The

went
to
carry
out
the
order
.
The
doctor
hurriedly
consulted
