She
looked
at
him
without
a
word
,
and
increased
the
pitiful
fixity
of
her
temples
,
as
if
to
keep
down
pain
.
"
You
murdered
Alice
Walmsley's
child
!
"
Her
eyes
gaze
by
raising
her
hands
to
press
her
closed
,
and
she
grasped
at
her
breast
with
both
hands
,
and
tottered
backwards
,
sinking
on
the
bench
with
a
long
moan
.
"
You
killed
the
child
,
and
you
saw
the
innocent
mother
dragged
to
prison
for
your
crime
.
You
have
remained
silent
for
nine
years
,
and
destroyed
your
own
life
,
while
she
has
borne
your
punishment
.
You
shall
now
confess
,
and
save
her
who
has
suffered
so
much
to
save
you
.
"
!!
"
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
"
screamed
the
woman
,
in
a
laugh
so
sudden
and
hellish
,
that
Mr.
Wyville
stepped
back
appalled
.
He
had
expected
a
different
result
.
Again
and
again
the
horrid
laugh
rang
through
the
place
,
till
it
bad
exhausted
the
strength
of
the
ferocious
and
most
miserable
being
who
uttered
it
,
and
she
sank
heavily
on
the
bench
"
Save
her
!
"
she
cried
at
length
,
clenching
her
hands
,
and
shaking
them
over
her
head
.
"
Ha
!
ha
!
save
her
!
Save
the
false
woman
that
sent
me
here
!
Never
!
I
hate
her
!
She
brought
her
suffering
,
on
herself
by
stealing
husband
--
he
was
only
a
fool
in
her
hands
!
"
my
She
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
for
a
time
,
and
then
cried
wildly-
-
"
Why
should
I
forgive
her
?
Why
should
I
save
her
?
Am
I
to
bear
all
the
misery
she
made
?
He
was
my
husband
,
and
he
loved
me
,
till
she
made
him
false
!
"
Here
she
became
wildly
excited
,
almost
screaming
her
words
.
"
If
she
were
free
to
-
day
,
she
would
seek
him
out
,
and
back
to
him
.
Why
should
I
save
her
to
do
that
?
go
Begone
!
I
will
not
!
I
know
nothing
about
her
.
I
would
rather
die
than
speak
a
word
to
save
her
!
"
A
fit
of
coughing
,
that
almost
convulsed
the
miserable
frame
,
now
seized
the
woman
;
and
when
it
had
passed
she
sank
back
against
the
wall
,
exhausted
.
down
upon
Mr.
Wyville
remained
silent
;
he
feared
that
more
excitement
might
affect
her
reason
,
or
her
life
.
He
looked
the
unfortunate
being
with
profound
pity
.
He
had
expected
a
depraved
and
selfish
nature
,
shrinking
from
confession
through
selfish
fear
.
He
saw
,
instead
,
a
woman's
heart
criminal
through
its
own
love
and
truth
,
and
cruelly
unjust
through
jealousy
of
its
rival
.
"
Darkest
and
saddest
of
human
sights
--
the
good
tortured
from
its
straight
t
course
until
it
actually
had
become
evil
,
the
angelic
quality
in
a
heart
warped
by
deceit
and
wrong
until
it
had
become
the
fiendish
part
.
"
O
,
man
:
man
!
"
murmured
Mr.
Wyville
,
as
he
looked
upon
the
wreck
,
but
only
saw
the
evil
-
doer
beyond
her
,
"
your
sin
is
deeper
than
the
sea
.
Not
here
,
not
here
must
I
seek
to
right
the
wrong
.
"
He
walked
from
the
place
with
bowed
head
.
Officer
Lodge
,
without
speaking
,
locked
the
door
,
and
followed
him
.
Mr.
Wyville
sat
down
in
the
court
-
room
,
and
,
after
a
long
pause
,
said
to
Officer
Lodge
--
"
Has
this
man
,
Draper
,
ever
been
here
-
-since
the
crime
was
committed
?
"
"
No
,
sir
,
he
hasn't
never
been
seen
;
but
they
say
as
he
has
been
here
;
that
he
came
in
the
night
to
his
own
folks
ance
.
He
can't
never
live
in
Walton
,
sir
.
"
"
Has
he
been
outlawed
?
"
"
No
,
sir
,
there
was
no
one
to
go
again
'
him
.
The
law
let
him
pass
;
but
the
people
couldn't
stomach
him
,
though
they
never
thought
he
was
as
bad
as
this
.
"
"
You
have
heard
,
then
,
what
I
have
said
to
this
woman
?
It
will
do
no
good
to
speak
about
it
.
She
has
made
no
confession
,
;
nor
will
she
confess
till
the
hand
of
death
is
upon
her
.
When
is
she
to
be
tried
for
this
last
offence
?
"
"
In
two
weeks
,
sir
,
and
she'll
get
at
least
seven
my
"
years
.
long
as
she
is
in
your
charge
,
treat
kind
friend
,
remember
she
has
been
cruelly
wronged
;
and
,
so
I
"
Well
,
her
with
mercy
.
She
is
not
the
author
of
her
crime
and
wretchedness
.
'
"
Officer
Lodge
promised
to
be
kind
,
though
his
heart
overflowed
when
he
thought
of
poor
Alice
Walmsley
and
her
great
wrong
.
He
also
promised
to
send
by
mail
to
Mr.
Wyville
a
report
of
Harriet
Draper's
sentence
.
Mr.
Wyville
thanked
him
,
but
offered
.
no
reward
"
I
shall
see
you
again
before
long
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
left
the
little
court
-
room
.
His
journey
to
London
that
night
was
mainly
consumed
in
reflection
on
the
tangled
web
of
crime
and
injustice
in
which
he
had
become
so
deeply
interested
Two
days
later
Mr.
Wyville
sat
in
the
office
of
the
governor
of
Millbank
,
relating
to
him
the
story
of
Harriet
Draper
and
Alice
Walmsley
.
"
Good
heavens
!
"
cried
the
kind
old
governor
,
"
the
case
must
be
brought
at
once
l
before
the
Directors
.
"
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
not
yet
;
and
not
at
any
time
before
them
.
Release
cannot

the
wrong
of
this
injured
