as

they
are

in

not
very

In
the
village
of
Mornington
there
is
such
a
majority
of
righteous
and
honest
men
,
that
a

sheep
would
be
quite
crushed
by
the
overwhelming
odds
against

of
those
who
found
no
cause
for
admiration

respect
in
his
drunken
argies
,
his
boastful
talk
,
or
his
other
evil
habits

And

Or
if
he
were

steeped
in
vice
and
wedded
to
iniquity
,
whom
nothing
could
influence
to

he
would
then
depart
from
Mornington
at
the

opportunity
and
seek
a
congenial
resort

people
would
no
doubt
call
Mornington
.
Perhaps
it
is
so
;
as
it
has
not
yet

learnt
to
grumble
at
what
it
has
,
;
or
covet
something
unreasonable
and
unattainable
.
In
short
,
it
is
contented
,
and
therein
lies
its
offence
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
thus
malign
it
.
Long
may
it
be
behind
the

in
this
respect

This
was
no

coming

little

of

desert

himself

And
yet
Harold
Mornington
had
done
,
or
rather
had
been
forced
to
do
by
circumstances
.
With
the
remembrance
before
them
of
his
long
exile
and
wasted
youth
,
no
wonder
that
tenants
and
labourers
,
and
all
who
made
up
the
population
of
the
district
,
should
unite
to
show
their
sympathy
by
giving
their
lord
a
hearty
welcome

A
moment
later
,
indeed
,
the
Mornington
landau
was
seen
rounding
the
corner
,
followed
by
a
little
troop
of
horsemen
.
"
Hurrah

Hats
were
waved
,
and
throats
became
hoarse
with
cheering
,
whilst
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
occupant
of
the
front
seat
of
the
vehicle
.
He
stood
up
to
bow
his
thanks
,
and
when
they
saw
him
rise
,
and
recalled
in
his
face
and
marked
the

which

the

race

saw
the
old

,

and
spoke
a

:
