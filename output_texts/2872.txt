hours
of
the
night
on
his
bed
of
torture
.
WALKING
IN
THE
SHADOW
.
THERE
was
nothing
apparent
in
the
possibilities
of
Alice
Walmsley's
new
life
to
disturb
the
calm
flow
of
her
returning
happiness
.
Even
her
wise
and
watchful
friend
,
Sister
Cecilia
,
smiled
hopefully
as
she
ventured
to
glance
into
the
future
.
"
But
when
the
sky
was
clearest
,
the
cloud
came
up
on
the
horizon
,
though
at
first
it
was
"
no
man's
hand
"
larger
than
a
The
visits
of
Mr.
Wyville
to
Farmer
Little's
pleasant
house
were
frequent
and
continuous
.
Mr.
Little's
colonial
title
was
Farmer
;
but
he
was
a
gentleman
of
taste
,
and
had
a
demesne
and
residence
as
extensive
as
an
English
duke
.
He
was
hospitable
,
as
all
rich
Australians
are
;
and
he
was
proud
to
entertain
so
distinguished
a
man
as
Mr.
Wyville
.
Gravely
and
quietly
,
from
his
first
visit
,
Mr.
Wyville
had
devoted
his
attention
to
Alice
Walmsley
,
and
in
such
a
manner
that
his
purpose
should
not
be
misunderstood
by
Mr.
Little
or
his
wife
.
Indeed
,
it
was
quite
plain
to
them
long
before
it
was
dreamt
of
by
Alice
herself
.
From
the
first
,
she
had
been
treated
as
a
friend
by
these
estimable
people
,
but
after
a
while
she
began
to
observe
something
in
their
manner
that
puzzled
her
.
They
were
no
less
kind
than
formerly
;
but
they
grew
a
little
strange
,
as
if
they
had
not
quite
understood
her
position
&
first
.
at
for
any
on
Alice
could
discover
no
reason
.
change
;
;
so
she
went
on
quietly
from
day
to
day
.
Mr.
Wyville
always
drew
her
into
conversation
when
he
came
there
;
and
with
him
she
found
herself
as
invariably
talking
.
subjects
which
no
one
else
touched
,
and
which
she
understood
perfectly
.
It
seemed
as
if
he
held
a
key
to
her
mind
,
and
instinctively
knew
the
lines
of
reflection
she
had
followed
during
her
years
of
intense
solitude
.
Alice
herself
would
have
forgotten
these
reflections
had
they
not
been
brought
to
her
recollection
.
Now
,
they
recurred
to
her
pleasantly
,
there
are
so
few
persons
who
have
any
stock
of
individual
thought
to
draw
upon
.
She
took
a
ready
and
deep
interest
in
every
plan
of
Mr.
Wyville
for
the
benefit
of
the
convicts
;
and
he
,
seeing
this
,
made
his
purposes
,
even
for
many
years
ahead
,
known
to
her
,
and
advised
with
her
often
.
changes
that
might
here
and
there
be
made
.
on
One
evening
,
just
at
twilight
,
when
the
ladies
of
the
family
were
sitting
,
under
the
wide
verandah
,
looking
down
on
the
darkened
river
,
Mrs.
Little
pleasantly
but
slyly
said
something
that
made
Alice's
cheek
flame
.
Alice
raised
her
face
with
a
pained
and
reproachful
look
.
"
There
now
,
Alice
,
"
said
the
lady
,
coming
to
her
with
a
kind
caress
;
"
you
musn't
think
it
strange
.
We
can't
help
seeing
it
,
you
know
.
"
"
What
do
you
see
?
"
asked
Alice
in
bewilderment
.
"
Mr.
Wyville's
devotion
,
dear
.
We
are
all
delighted
to
think
of
your
marriage
with
so
good
and
eminent
a
man
.
'
Alice
sank
back
in
her
chair
,
utterly
nerveless
.
It
was
so
dark
they
did
not
see
her
sudden
paleness
.
She
held
the
arms
of
her
chair
with
each
hand
,
and
was
silent
for
so
long
a
time
that
Mrs.
Little
feared
she
had
Wounded
her
.
"
Forgive
me
if
I
have
pained
you
,
Alice
,
"
she
said
kindly
.
you
"
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
"
said
Alice
,
with
quivering
lips
;
"
I
thank
y
with
all
my
heart
.
I
did
not
know
-
-
I
did
not
think
-
-
"
She
did
not
finish
the
sentence
.
Mrs.
Little
,
seeing
that
her
rallying
had
bad
quite
another
effect
from
that
moon
.
This
was
as
burnished
intended
,
came
to
Alice's
aid
by
a
sudden
exclamation
about
the
beauty
of
the
rising
bright
successful
;
for
ten
minutes
every
eye
was
turned
on
the
lovely
crescent
that
rose
,
as
silver
,
above
the
dark
line
of
forest
.
In
the
midst
of
this
admiration
,
Alice
slipped
away
from
the
happy
group
,
and
spent
the
evening
alone
in
her
own
room
.
A
few
days
later
,
she
sat
in
the
arbour
of
the
convent
garden
,
while
Sister
Cecilia
watered
her
flower
beds
.
Sitting
so
,
her
mind
went
reaching
back
after
a
one
memorable
incident
in
her
life
.
And
by
.
already
-
vibrating
chord
was
touched
at
that
moment
by
the
little
nun
.
"
Here
is
my
first
are
.
"
"
some
chance
,
the
rose
-
bud
,
Alice
,
"
she
said
,
coming
into
the
arbour
;
"
see
how
pretty
those
two
young
leaves
Alice's
eyes
were
suffused
with
tears
as
she
bent
her
head
over
the
lovely
bud
.
It
appealed
to
her
now
,
in
the
midst
of
her
happiness
,
with
unspeakable
tenderness
of
recollection
.
She
held
it
to
her
lips
,
almost
prayerful
,
so
moved
that
she
could
not
speak
.
"
Only
think
,
"
continued
Sister
Cecilia
,
"
for
nine
months
to
come
we
shall
never
want
for
roses
and
buds
.
Ah
me
!
I
think
we
value
them
less
for
their
plenty
.
It's
a
good
thing
to
visit
the
prison
now
and
again
,
isn't
it
,
Alice
?
We
love
rosebuds
all
the
better
for
remembering
the
weeds
.
"
Alice
raised
her
head
,
and
looked
her
eloquent
assent
at
Sister
Cecilia
.
