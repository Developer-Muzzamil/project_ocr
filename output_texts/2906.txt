something
special
doing
:
on
such
rare
occasions
,
however
when
cub
-
hunting
or
the
exigencies
of
travelling
required
it
,
he
would
stroll
down
,
even
if
it
were
five
o'clock
,
faultlessly
dressed
as
usual
,
and
without
the
least
sign
of
unwanted
exertion
.
In
fact
,
Godfrey
was
one
of
those
to
whom
nothing
appears
a
trouble
,
and
nobody
could
ever
remember
him
engaging
in
any
enterprise
,
attempting
any
part
in
which
he
was
not
perfectly
successful
.
Hence
,
it
was
inevitable
that
Eva
and
her
chaperon
were
the
only
occupants
of
the
squire's
pen
,
or
greatly
to
the
disappointment
of
all
,
if
we
except
Harry
Averill
,
to
whom
the
absence
of
Mr.
Mornington
was
an
unfeigned
relief
.
After
the
service
he
was
sufficiently
emboldened
to
accost
Eva
,
and
considered
himself
fully
the
two
ladies
across
the
sermon
repaid
for
his
five
-
mile
walk
by
permission
,
unspoken
though
it
was
,
to
accompany
t
field
to
the
private
gate
of
the
grounds
.
A
few
very
commonplace
observations
,
chiefly
originating
from
Mrs.
Neville
,
and
assented
to
by
Harry
Averill
and
Eva
;
a
comment
from
the
former
that
the
length
,
of
the
.
made
it
one
severe
infliction
which
had
not
been
imposed
.
on
the
patriarch
,
and
a
general
laugh
at
the
eccentricities
of
the
curate's
style
;
this
was
the
conversation
.
Then
a
courteous
invitation
from
Eva
,
hesitatingly
refused
,
a
shaking
of
hands
,
a
bright
smile
,
and
Harry
Averill
passed
from
a
paradise
of
the
present
to
one
of
retrospection
,
which
latter
was
sufficient
to
make
his
walk
home
pass
magic
.
Poor
fellow
!
victim
of
a
complaint
most
boys
experience
,
at
that
stage
,
when
passing
from
school
to
college
â€”
a
little
more
respect
from
inferiors
,
a
"
Mr.
"
instead
of
"
Master
,
"
and
faint
indications
of
a
moustache
;
these
imbue
them
with
the
idea
that
they
have
in
a
single
day
leaped
from
boyhood
to
manhood
.
Cultivate
your
grande
passionand
your
moustaches
by
all
means
,
Harry
Averill
,
the
latter
.
come
to
something
,
the
former
is
hopeless
,
but
it
will
do
you
no
harm
!
A
few
sighs
and
soft
reveries
,
a
little
despair
,
some
rash
resolves
soon
abandoned
;
ay
may
like
;
even
a
tear
or
two
will
merely
help
to
steel
your
heart
against
time
to
come
,
when
your
wooing
will
be
more
serious
.
That
,
evening
4
Mr.
Mornington
announced
his
intention
of
running
up
to
London
on
the
following
day
.
"
I
find
,
"
he
deigned
to
explain
,
"
that
several
matters
on
which
Mr.
Woodruff
requires
my
instructions
,
can
be
more
down
.
"
satisfactorily
attended
to
in
London
.
I
shall
there
be
able
to
consult
documents
not
possible
to
bring
"
Going
away
so
soon
?
"
queried
Eva
,
reproachfully
.
"
I
thought
we
were
to
have
another
ride
to
-
morrow
.
"
"
I
shall
be
away
for
only
a
very
short
time
,
my
dear
,
"
answered
Mr.
Mornington
,
"
and
,
you
need
not
be
disappointed
as
far
as
a
ride
,
for
I
daresay
Godfrey
will
g
Il
go
out
with
you
.
There
are
reasons
am
not
sorry
why
I
to
have
an
opportunity
of
being
in
London
,
although
I
expect
I
shall
find
myself
quite
a
stranger
there
.
"
Godfrey
threw
over
a
whale
to
catch
the
sprat
of
accompanying
his
father
,
but
the
latter
only
shook
his
head
.
"
There
is
no
necessity
for
that
,
as
I
shall
be
back
on
Wednesday
,
at
the
latest
,
good
-
night
to
all
!
I
have
ordered
the
dog-
y
-
cart
to
catch
the
early
train
,
so
I
am
to
bed
in
good
time
.
"
Very
surprised
were
the
solitary
porter
and
the
unique
stationmaster
at
the
little
terminus
when
the
dog
-
cart
from
the
Abbey
deposited
Mr.
Mornington
at
the
station
at
eight
,
with
a
small
hand
-
bag
and
travelling
rug
a.m.
,
as
his
scanty
luggage
,
very
officious
they
were
in
dusting
and
cleaning
up
the
one
first
-
class
carriage
seldom
used
,
but
their
obsequiousness
met
with
little
response
save
a
curt
nod
,
and
their
preparations
for
his
comfort
but
brief
thanks
.
It
was
not
that
Mr.
Mornington
was
grudging
,
but
the
frown
and
the
absent
manner
betrayed
,
perchance
,
more
important
business
on
hand
than
a
mere
consultation
and
examination
of
deeds
with
his
solicitor
.
At
the
junction
on
the
main
line
the
express
was
late
,
but
the
traveller
scarcely
noticed
the
delay
,
pacing
the
long
platform
with
regular
strides
and
downeast
head
,
deeply
engaged
in
thought
,
and
furnishing
abundant
cause
for
gossip
between
the
guard
and
engine
-
driver
of
the
local
train
"
My
!
he
be
a
lucky
gen
'
leman
,
and
no
mistake
,
"
remarked
the
latter
,
watching
the
magnate's
every
motion
with
interest
.
"
That's
as
it
may
be
,
"
replied
the
other
,
sententiously
.
"
To
my
mind
,
he
looks
more
like
a
man
who'd
got
a
heap
of
trouble
on
his
mind
,
than
anything
else
.
If
he's
as
unhappy
as
he
looks
,
I
would
not
change
berths
with
him
,
not
for
all
his
fine
lands
and
his
power
o
'
money
.

Right

!
you
are
a
philosopher

If

,

He
took
a
hansom
,
and
only
calling
on
the
way
at
a
cutler's
shop
,
where
he
made
a
purchase
,
he
was
driven
rapidly
to
the
Great
Western
Terminus
.
Here
he
booked
for
Oxford
.
On

there
,
he
did
not
leave

took

In
about
an
hour's
time
,
the
slow
train
deposited
him

the
sole
on
the
narrow
platform
at
Redford
.
He
left
his
rug
and
bag
in
care
of
the
porter
,
and
proceeded
on

towards
