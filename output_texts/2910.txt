If
this
were
so
,
¿
Mr.
Mornington
did
not
delay
to
revive
his
reminiscences
.
But
passing
straight
along
the
main
street
he
came
to
the
outskirts
,
where
,
on
the
right
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
stood
the
old
church
,
whose
steeple
,
once
a
landmark
,
was
knocked
off
by
the
cannons
of
Oliver
Cromwell
.
On
the
left
,
at
intervals
,
were
a
few

residences

added
that

be
obtained
,
with
permission
to

,
at
the
adjoining
house
,
which
was
the
residence
of
Mr.

.

as
he
leant
over
the
low
wall
and
read
,
it
.
After
silent
contemplation
of
the
bare
windows
and
neglected
grounds
,
he
roused
himself
,
and
entering
the
garden
of
the
adjoining
house
,
the
bell
and
asked
the
trim
maid
who
answered
it
,
for
leave
to
view
the
empty
house
.
She
fetched
the
key
,
and
together
they
pushed

gate

walked
down

he
said
to
the
usher
;
"

He
slipped
a

,

the
form
of
her
whose
memory
was
the
attraction
luring
him
here
.
Longest
of
all
,
he
lingered
in
the
little
front
parlour
,
his
face
greatly
softened
;
though
the
bare
walls
,
from
which
the
once
bright
paper
was
hanging
down
loosely
,
were
faded
and
discoloured
,
and
the
floors
were
thick
with
dust
.
He
saw
none
of
these
evidences
of
the
decayed
appearance
of
the
room
:
:
for
him
there
was
a
cheerful
fire
in
the
rusty
grate
,
a
carpet
thicker
than
the
dust
on
the
floor
,
pictures
and
well

on
the
ragged
walls
.
That
firelight
of
fancy
illumined
the
room
,
and
was
reflected
from
the
sweet
,
loving
face
of
the
phantom
tenant
of
the
chair
by
the
fireplace
.
Again
she
smiled
up
at
him
as
none
ever
smiled
since
on
him
;
again
she
looked
and
again
she
spoke
as
never
woman
had
spoken
and
looked

I
on
him
.
Over
the
smiling
face
a
cloud
of
unhappiness
abruptly
gathered
,
suffering
,
too
,
was
there
—
and
fierce
hatred
flashed
anew
—
as
once
,
and
only
he
saw
it
—
out
of
the
most
often
mournful
eyes
.
Burning
indignation
fired
those
lips
,
too
prematurely
pale
,
as
they
pealed
.
Ia
curse
on
the
name
he
bore
—
a
curse
that
had
clung
to
him
undetachably
.
The
blending
of
evanescent
joy
and
undying
grief
pervaded
him
and
bound
him
there
until
the
minutes
grew
into
hours
,
and
at
length
the
servant
who
had
left
him
the
key
grew
anxious
,
and
came
in
to
see
why
he
stayed
so
long

At

"
Do

was
the
reply
.
Without
another
word
he
took
the
road
and
began
ascending
the
hill
,
at
the
top
of
which
stood
the
church
:
After
examining
the
churchyard
,
he
opened
the
wide
gate
and
walked
slowly
up
the
gravel
path
,
examining
the
head
-
stones
.
His
search
for
the
dead
was
not
a
long
one
,
there
being
but
few
graves
,
and
the
one
he
sought
conspicuous
by
its
simplicity
.
A
plain
tablet
bearing
only
the
initials
"
E.
M.
"
at
the
head
of
the
mound
,
was
its
only
ornament
.
For
a
space
this
cold
,
reserved
man
swayed
with
weakness
before
the
lowly
memorial
;
this
once
he
lost
in
the
battle
for
self
-
control
,
and
casting
himself
down
on
the
ground
,
with
a
choking
sob
,
he
knelt
by
the
side
of
the
grave
and
wept
.
one
jot
.
A
strong
man's
tears
are
always
terrible
;
but
when
the
man
is
a
man
of
iron
nerve
and
resolution
,
such
outcome
of
grief
is
doubly
painful
,
and
the
sight
.
t
one
never
to
be
forgotten
.
Few
there
are
who
would
not
have
pitied
Harold
Mornington
as
his
proud
face
was
distorted
with
passionate
weeping
,
and
his
haughty
head
bowed
in
misery
.
Twenty
years
of
hardship
and
poverty
had
not
lowered
it

Men
