MR . WYVILLE
AT the hotel , Sheridan found a note from Lord Somers requesting him , if disengaged , to call upon him that
afternoon . Half an hour later , he and the Colonial Secretary were riding together towards the West End .
" By the way , Mr. Sheridan , " said Lord Somers , " there is a gentleman in London I want you to meet , who knows
a great deal about the Australian colonies , and especially about the West . He is our chief adviser on the
proposed reform of the Penal System . "
Indeed said Sheridan , interested at once . This is the second time to - day , I surmise , that I have heard of him . Is
his name Wyville ? "
" Yes , do you ! know him ? "
" No , " answered Sheridan ; " I have never heard of him . Sir Joshua Hobb does not like his reformatory ideas- -
which inclines me to think Mr. Wyville must be a superior man . "

compelled to be antagonistic to each other . "
" You admire Mr. Wyville , my Lord ? " asked Sheridan .
" Thoroughly , " answered Lord Somers . " He is a most remarkable man- -a man of exalted principles and
extraordinary power . His information is astonishing -- and what he speaks about , he knows absolutely . I fancy
he has lived a long time in the colonies , for he is enormously wealthy . "
" Is he an old man ? " asked Sheridan .

" No , I don't think he can be forty -- certainly not more but a person of so much force , and with a manner so
impressive , that really one forgets to think of his age . He is altogether a notable man- -and I
confidence , that even the Prime Minister has more than once consulted him with advantage on Colonial
affairs . "
" You interest me
We are
exceedingly , " said Sheridan . " Such , men are not common in Australia '
beginning to think otherwise , " laughed the Secretary . " And yet you Australians seem to learn
everything without newspapers . I remember , when Mr. Wyville first appeared here , some years ago , he might
have dropped from the moon , so oblivious was he of the doings of the European world . "
" He must have lived in the bush , " said Sheridan , smiling .
" Why , he had never heard of the Crimean War , " said the Secretary ; " and when I mentioned the Indian Mutiny
removed from civilization-- to him , day , he gravely stared , and asked " What mutiny ? ‚Äù Are you so utterly re

from news , in your bush ? "
" Well , Mr. Wyville must certainly have had the minimum of society , " responded Will ; " we usually get a report ,
however vague , of what your civilization is doing . "
" Shall we call on Mr. Wyville ? " asked Lord Somers ; " he lives in Grosvenor Street . "
" I shall be delighted to meet him , " said Sheridan ; and a few minutes afterwards they stopped before a large
and handsome mansion .
Mr. Wyville was at home . A coloured servant showed the gentlemen into a rich reception - room , in which
Sheridan's quick eye noted many Australian features of decoration .
The coloured servant seemed a negro , of the common (

He smiled at the absurdity of the thought , but was struck once more by the man's air as he turned to the door .
