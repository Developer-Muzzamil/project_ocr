The
warders
fairly
gasped
with
astonishment
.
The
old
Governor
,
who
had
listened
attentively
at
first
,
opened
his
eyes
wide
,
then
nodded
his
head
in
decided
approval
.
Mr.
Wyville
read
the
heads
of
the
new
law
,
emphasizing
the
mild
points
.
As
he
proceeded
,
the
faces
of
the
warders
lost
all
expression
but
one
.
of
blank
amazement
.
The
entire
meaning
of
the
law
was
that
convicts
were
expected
to
rise
from
bad
to
good
,
rather
than
descend
from
bad
to
worse
.
In
other
words
,
it
was
a
law
meant
for
reformation
,
not
for
vengeance
.
In
passing
along
the
line
,
Mr.
Wyville's
eye
rested
on
a
silver
medal
worn
by
keenly
"
What
is
that
medal
for
?
"
he
asked
.
one
of
the
warders
.
He
looked
at
it
"
For
the
mutiny
of
two
years
ago
,
"
said
the
chief
warder
;
"
this
officer
killed
three
mutineers
.
"
"
Take
that
medal
off
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
to
the
warder
,
"
and
never
put
it
on
again
.
We
are
to
have
no
more
mutiny
.
"
"
The
warders
were
then
dismissed
from
the
rank
,
and
instructed
to
below
and
get
the
convicts
in
order
for
go
disembarkation
.
As
they
departed
,
Mr.
Wyville
gave
them
one
word
more
.
"
Remember
,
you
are
dealing
with
men
,
not
with
brutes
-
-
with
men
who
have
rights
and
the
protection
of
law
.
"
When
they
had
disappeared
into
the
bold
,
the
old
Governor
shook
Mr.
Wyville
warmly
by
the
hand
.
"
By
the
lord
Harry
,
sir
,
this
is
excellent
,
"
he
said
,
heartily
.
"
This
d
--
d
colony
has
been
a
menagerie
long
enough
.
If
you
succeed
with
civilized
country
at
last
.

A
PRISONER
AT
LARGE
i
your
system
,
we'll
make
it
a
THE
disembarkation
of
the
convicts
was
a
novel
scene
to
them
,
and
to
the
officers
directing
their
movements
.
The
absence
of
shouting
and
violence
made
it
quite
unprecedented
to
the
warders
.
The
convicts
reached
the
wharf
on
barges
,
and
marched
in
single
file
up
the
little
street
leading
to
the
Fremantle
.
great
gate
of
the
prison
of
on
to
the
prison
.
Inside
the
gate
,
in
the
centre
of
an
immense
yard
I
or
walled
sand
plain
,
the
Governor
and
Comptroller
-
General
stood
;
and
as
the
long
line
of
convicts
filed
by
,
each
saluted
in
military
fashion
,
and
passed
It
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
last
convict
passed
.
The
Governor
was
about
to
leave
the
ground
,
when
his
attention
was
called
to
one
more
stranger
from
the
ship
,
who
approached
.
It
was
Captain
Draper
.
He
walked
slowly
,
as
if
still
feeble
from
his
illness
;
but
he
was
carefully
dressed
,
and
was
really
much
more
vigorous
than
he
pretended
.
He
raised
his
hat
to
the
Governor
as
he
approached
,
and
received
a
curt
return
of
the
salute
,
followed
by
a
cold
stare
.
The
Governor
had
looked
into
Captain
Draper's
case
that
forenoon
.
"
Shall
I
retain
the
crew
,
your
Excellency
?
"
said
Draper
,
with
an
obsequious
smile
,
"
or
is
the
ship
to
go
out
of
commission
for
the
present
?
"
"
I
don't
know
,
Sir
,
"
said
the
stiff
old
Governor
,
not
hiding
his
dislike
and
contempt
;
"
and
I
don't
care
,
Sir
.
The
ship
belongs
to
the
convict
department
.
"
He
turned
on
his
heel
as
he
spoke
.
"
Captain
Draper
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
in
an
official
tone
,
"
you
are
relieved
of
your
command
.
The
ship
goes
out
of
commission
.
"
Draper's
face
was
a
study
of
disappointment
at
the
news
.
"
"
The
crew
will
remain
-
-
"
he
began
.
"
The
crew
will
be
taken
to
Adelaide
on
my
yacht
,
which
will
arrive
this
week
.
"
"
Shall
I
have
quarters
on
board
?
"
asked
Draper
,
with
an
alarmed
look
.
"
No
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
,
shortly
.
"
You
must
seek
some
other
means
of
transport
.
"
"
But
,
"
said
Draper
,
imploringly
,
"
there
are
no
.
ships
in
the
colony
,
;
nor
are
any
expected
.
I
shall
have
to
remain
here
.
"
True
,
"
said
the
Governor
,
who
enjoyed
the
scene
.
"
There
will
be
no
visitors
here
for
twelve
months
to
come
,
nor
any
means
of
leaving
.
"
Draper
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
men
before
him
;
but
he
drew
no
gleam
of
satisfaction
from
their
faces
.
He
began
to
feel
a
sinking
of
the
heart
,
such
as
all
cowards
feel
in
the
presence
of
danger
.
He
instinctively
knew
that
his
cunning
had
been
overreached
,
and
was
useless
.
He
knew
not
where
to
look
for
the
hand
that
had
played
against
him
,
but
through
every
nerve
the
knowledge
rushed
on
him
that
he
had
been
overmastered
by
a
superior
intelligence
--
that
he
was
beaten
,
discovered
,
and
impotent
.
This
knowledge
came
suddenly
,
but
it
came
overwhelmingly
.
At
one
e
glance
he
saw
that
he
had
been
led
into
a
trap
,
and
that
the
door
had
just
closed
.
He
turned
to
Mr.
Wyville
,
crestfallen
.
"
If
you
refuse
to
let
me
go
on
the
steamer
,
I
might
as
well
be
a
prisoner
here
.
"
"
Precisely
,
"
said
Mr.
Wyville
.
