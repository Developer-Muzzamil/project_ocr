"
That
Vapour
looks
like
smoke
,
"
he
said
to
the
convict
clerk
in
the
office
;
"
What
is
it
?
"
"
It
is
smoke
,
sir
,
"
said
the
man
.
"
This
is
the
year
for
the
bush
fires
.
"
Just
then
Mr.
Wyville
entered
,
and
their
meeting
was
cordial
.
Mr.
Wyville
,
who
looked
tired
,
said
he
had
only
hour's
writing
to
do
,
after
which
he
would
ride
to
Perth
.
He
asked
Hamerton
to
wait
,
and
handed
him
some
late
the
time
.
English
papers
to
pass
t
Hamerton
soon
tired
of
his
reading
,
and
having
laid
aside
the
paper
,
his
eyes
.
rested
on
Mr.
Wyville
,
who
was
intently
occupied
,
bending
over
his
desk
.
Hamerton
almost
started
with
surprise
at
the
change
he
observed
in
his
appearance
--
a
change
that
was
not
easily
apparent
when
the
face
was
animated
in
conversation
.
When
they
sailed
from
England
,
Mr.
Wyville's
hair
was
as
black
as
a
raven
;
but
now
,
even
across
the
room
,
Hamerton
could
see
that
it
was
streaked
with
white
.
The
features
,
too
,
had
grown
thin
,
like
those
of
a
person
who
had
suffered
in
sickness
.
But
,
when
the
hour
had
passed
,
and
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
smilingly
at
Hamerton
,
it
was
the
same
striking
face
,
and
the
same
grand
presence
as
of
old
.
Still
,
Hamerton
could
not
forget
the
change
he
had
observed
.
"
Come
,
"
he
said
,
unable
to
conceal
an
unusual
affectionate
earnestness
,
"
let
us
ride
to
Perth
,
and
rest
there
--
you
need
rest
.
"
"
Why
,
I
never
felt
better
,
"
answered
Mr.
Wyville
,
lightly
;
"
and
rest
is
rust
to
me
.
I
never
rest
unless
I.
"
You
will
soon
be
ill
if
this
continue
.
"
"
Do
o
you
"
think
so
?
"
and
as
he
asked
the
question
,
Hamerton
saw
a
strange
light
in
his
.
eye
.
am
ill
"
"
"
Yes
,
I
think
you
have
overtaxed
yourself
lately
.
You
are
in
danger
of
breaking
down
--
so
you
ought
to
rest
.
"
Hamerton
was
puzzled
to
see
him
shake
his
head
sadly
.
"
No
,
no
,
I
am
too
strong
to
break
down
.
Death
passes
some
people
,
you
know
;
and
I
am
one
-of
the-
fortunate
.
"
Hamerton
did
not
like
the
tone
nor
the
mood
.
He
had
never
seen
him
so
before
.
He
determined
to
hurry
their
departure
.
4.
He
walked
out
of
the
office
and
waited
in
the
prison
yard
.
Mr.
Wyville
joined
him
in
a
few
moments
.
"
I
thought
this
smoke
was
only
a
sultry
air
,
"
Hamerton
said
;
"
where
does
it
come
from
?
"
"
I
think
it
comes
from
Bunbury
district
;
a
native
runner
.
from
there
miles
in
that
direction
.
"
says
the
bush
is
burning
for
a
hundred
"
"
Are
lives
lost
in
these
fires
?
A
hundred
miles
of
flame
is
hard
to
picture
in
the
mind
.
"
"
Yes
,
some
unlucky
travellers
and
wood
-
cutters
are
surrounded
at
times
;
and
the
destruction
of
lower
life
,
birds
,
animals
,
and
reptiles
,
is
beyond
computation
.
"
"
Does
not
the
fire
leave
a
desert
behind
?
"
"
For
a
season
the
rain
comes
vonly
;
but
it
also
leaves
the
earth
clear
for
a
new
growth
.
The
roots
are
not
destroyed
;
and
when
"
they
burst
forth
with
increased
beauty
for
the
fertilizing
passage
of
the
flame
.
"
By
this
time
t
they
were
riding
slowly
towards
Perth
.
The
road
was
shaded
with
tall
mahoganies
,
and
the
coolness
was
refreshing
.
Hamerton
seized
the
opportunity
of
bringing
up
a
subject
that
lay
upon
his
mind
.
"
You
gave
me
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
some
documents
in
London
which
you
wished
me
to
keep
until
our
arrival
here
.
Shall
I
not
return
them
to
-
morrow
?
'
Mr.
Wyville
rode
on
without
answering
.
He
had
heard
;
but
the
question
had
come
unexpectedly
.
Hamerton
remained
silent
until
he
spoke
.
།།
"
Do
not
return
them
yet
,
"
he
said
at
length
,
"
when
we
get
back
from
.
our
ride
to
the
Vasse
,
then
give
them
to
me
.
"
"
When
shall
we
start
?
"
"
In
ten
days
.
By
that
time
my
work
will
be
fairly
done
;
and
the
rest
you
spoke
of
may
not
come
amiss
.
"
"
Shall
we
ride
to
Sheridan's
settlement
?
"
"
O
no
;
we
go
inland
,
to
the
head
of
the
mountain
range
.
Those
papers
