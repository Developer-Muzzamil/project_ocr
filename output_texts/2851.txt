The
first
few
days
of
the
voyage
o
inexpressibly
horrible
.
The
hundreds
of
pent

up
wretches
are
unused
to
the
darkness
of
the
ship
,
strange
to
their
crowded
quarters
and
to
each
other
,
depressed
in
spirits
at
their
endless
separation
from
home
,
sickened
to
death
with
the
merciless
pitch
and
roll
of
the
vessel
,
alarmed
at
the
dreadful
thunder
of
the
waves
against
their
prison
walls
,
and
fearful
of
sudden
engulfment
,
with
the
hatches
barred
.
The
scene
is
too
hideous
for
a
picture
-
-
too
dreadful
to
be
described
in
words
.

Only
those
who
have
stood
within
the
bars
,
and
heard
the
din
of
devils
and
the
appalling
sounds
of
despair
,
blended
in
a
diapason
that
made
every

About
a
week
out
from
England
,
the
Houguemont
went
bowling
down
the
Atlantic
,
and
across
the
Bay
of
Biscay
.
The
night
was
cold
and
dark
,
and
the
strong
breeze
held
the
ship
steady
,
with
every
sail
drawing
.
Mr.
Wyville
and
Sheridan
,
the
latter
of
whom
had
come
on
deck
for
the
first
time
since
the
vessel
sailed
,
in
warm
greatcoats
,
walked
the
lee
side
of
the
poop
;
while
the
captain
,
also
heavily
wrapped
,
paced
the
weather
side
,
glancing
now
and
again
at
the
sails
,
and
taking
an
occasional
look
at
the
course
.

"
asked
Mr.
Wyville
.
"
You
forget
that
I
I
am
a
sailor
,
Mr.
Wyville
,
"
he
said
.
"
I
had
another
reason
.
for
keeping
my
room
.
Will
Sheridan
,
for
months
past
,
had
often
been
on
the
point
of
telling
Mr.
Wyville
the
whole
story
of
his
life
,
his
love
for
Alice
Walmsley
,
and
her
terrible
suffering
for
another's
crime
;
but
the
moment
still
had
gone
by
,
and
he
had
never
broached
the
subject
.
He
longed
to
speak
his
warm
gratitude
to
the
wise
friend
who
had
preserved
Alice's
reason
and
life
in
Millbank
.
Mr.
Wyville
never
dreamt
that
Sheridan
and
Alice
Walmsley
had
known
each
other
.
He
did
not
know
that
on
the
deck
at
that
moment
stood
Sheridan's
deadliest
enemy
,
within
five
yards
of
the
man
he
hated
,
and
who
mortally
hated
him
.
"
I
will
tell
him
all
now
,
"
were
the
words
in
Sheridan's
mind
;
and
he
turned
to
Mr.
Wyville
,
and
took
hold
of
his
arm
.

They
paused
in
their
walk
,
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
mizzen
mast
.
At
that
moment
the
captain
went
towards
the
wheel
,
and
bent
his
head
to

glare
was
straight
before
Sheridan
.
His
eyes
were
arrested
by
it
as
land
closed
like
a
vice
on
the
arm
of
his
friend
.
"
God
Almighty
!
"
The
words
rushed
from
his
heart
in
a
hissing
whisper
.
Mr.
Wyville
was
astounded
,
but
he
could
not
even
surmise
the
cause
.
of
Sheridan's
tremendous
excitement
.
He
had
seen
the
face
of
the
captain
as
it
remained
for
a
moment
in
the
strong
light
;
but
he
did
not
connect
this
with
his
friend's
emotion
.
He
waited
for
Sheridan
to
speak
.
Instead
of
speaking
,
Sheridan
watched
the
dark
figure
of
the
captain
as
he
passed
from
the
wheel
to
the
weather
side
of
the
poops
and
paced
slowly
up
and
down
.
Then
he
drew
a
deep
breath
,
tremulous
with
aroused
passion
.
"
Who
is
that
man
?
"
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
,
after
a
long
look
.
"
That
is
the
captain
,
"
answered
Mr.
"
Wyville
.
"
Let
me
introduce
you
Captain
Draper
!
"
The
captain
walked
towards
them
.
Sheridan
remained
just
as
he
had
been
standing
"

"

said
Sheridan
,
laying
his
hand
on
Mr.
Wyville's
breast
,
"

moment

"
He
strode
to
the
binnacle
,
seized
the
lamp
,
and
returned
with
it
in
his
hand
.
When
he
was
within
two
feet
of
Draper
,
he
threw
the
light
full
on
his

The
sight
of
the
terrible
face
struck
Draper
like
a
physical
blow
.
His
breath
came
in
a
short
staggered
back
till
he
leaned
against
the
mast
.
He
never
said

word

and

Sheridan
turned
the
glare
of
the
lamp
upon
him
for
an
instant
,
then
snatched
it
rapidly
away
from
the
repulsive
sight
.
At
that
moment
,
with
the
veil
of
darkness
suddenly
torn
back
,
Draper's
face
was
ghastly
,
and
his
attitude
full
of
terror
.
Will
Sheridan
replaced
the
lamp
in
the
binnacle
,
and
walked
straight
to
his
own
room
.
Mr.
Wyville
was
profoundly
astonished
and
puzzled
at
this
scene
.
He
remained
on
deck
for
after
Sheridan's
abrupt
departure
;
but
he
did
not
speak
to
Captain
Draper
,
who
paced
