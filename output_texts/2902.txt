Eva
laughed
slightly
f
course
,
but
,
considering
we
are
twins
,
I
have
seen
very
little
of
him
.
It

two

since

!

"

,
"
said
Eva
;

I
hope
to
be
happier

you
have
come
home
,
that

"
she
added
timidly
,
and
half
-
frightened
at
her
plain
speech
,
as
she
peeped
tearfully
over
at
the
dark
,
stern
face
.
It
relaxed

he
answered

not
unkindly
:

sadly

f
my
life
in
a
circle
of
gloom
,
and
there
has
crept
over
my
feelings
,
my
affections

,
a
blight
which
I
cannot
at

dispel
.
I
wish

remember
this
,
-you
my
child
â€”
to
say
but
little
of
my
past
life
.
During
all
the
long
years
of
absence
I
have
existed
,
never
lived
;
and
there
has
come
upon
me
an
apathy

thrown
aside

sighed
deeply

that

me
seems
to
have
become
merely
a
mechanical
existence
.
I
cannot
help
it

I
seem
powerless
to
break
through
bonds
which
long

continued
habits
of

and
self

have
woven

in

would

quickened
my
caresses
and
endearments
which
would
have
refreshed
my

heart-
these
seem
mere
trifles
to
me
now
.
It
is
as
if
I
had
lost
the
power
to
appreciate
even
love
,
and
until
change
of
scene
and
condition
removes
and
expels
the
apathy
and
restores
to

my

you

one

When
he
had
finished
speaking
,
his
hearer
could
scarce
again
keep
the
tears
from
her
eyes
;
for
there
was
a
softened
ring
of
sadness
in
his
tones

could
not

came
round

she

"

that

of

that

"

he
repeated
dreamily
.
"
Yes
,
I

"
He
left
her
side
,
and
went
to
the
window
to
look
out
for
a
few
minutes
,
so
she
could
not
see
his
face

When
he

vanished

Eva
hurried
away
to
don
her
habit
.
The
ride
was
a

one

easy
True
,
her
father
was
occupied
most
of
the
time
talking
to
Mr.
Cameron
,
but
he
frequently
turned
to
her
with
hints
on
the
arrangement
of
her
reins
,
or
as
to
her
seat
,
which
,
showing
his
consideration
,
gratifies
her
.
Mr.
Mornington
himself
was
a
perfect
rider
,
and
Eva
was
never
tired
of
admiring
his
graceful
seat
,
and
the
skill
with
which
he
managed
his
rather
spirited
horse
.
Their
ride
was
a
long
one
,
and
when
home
again
,
it
was
considerably
past
the
luncheon
hour
.
Mr.
Mornington
assisted
his
daughter
to
alight
,
lingering
himself
to
leave
some
instructions
with
the
groom
.
"
When
he
followed
her
,
and
saw
her
standing
on
the
verandah
waiting
for
him
,
the
likeness
between
her
and
the
picture
in
the
dining
-
r
g
-
room
was
so
striking
,
that
he
could
not
repress
a
start
of
surprise
,
or
check
a
low
groan
which
arose
to
his
lips
.
It
was
the
same
pose
very
nearly
.
She
was
leaning
against
the
rail
with
the
skirt
of
her
habit
gathered
up
in
one
hand
,
while
with
the
other
she
was
idly
cutting
leaves
from
the
ivy
with
her
toy
riding
whip
.
The
colour
brought
to
her
cheeks
by
the
ride
,
and
the
happy
light
in
enhanced
to
the
fullest
extent
the
beauty
of
her
face
,
and
her
slender
but
bewitchingly
formed
figure
looked
to
the
best
advantage
in
her
close
-
fitting
attire
.
And
yet
,
to
look
on
her
was
painful
to
Mr.
Mornington
,
because
she
revived
his
first
love
.
He
hurried
house
together
,
his
abruptness
perplexing
her
.
Luncheon

without
a

,

from
Mrs.
Neville
,
who
,

,
was
quite
content
to
do
all
the
talking
,
and
