cold
and
frost
which
,
for
nine
months
out
of
the
twelve
,
holds
this
region
in
an
iron
grip
.
Around

a
small
clearing

been

the
ground
was
many
feet
thick

then
that
the
two
men
who
had
built
this
dwelling

place
lived
undisturbed
,
and
all
but
undreamt
of
.
The
two
inmates
were
seated
within
on
pine
log
segments
,
crouching
over
a
fast
dying
-
out
fire
,
its
decaying
embers
casting
a
fitful
glare
around
on
the
little
there
was
to
show
.
Bare
,
uneven
walls
,
against
one
side
of
which
stood
a
rough
cupboard
,
the
only
apology
for
furniture
,
save
the
seats
and
a
longer
stump
set
up
as
a
table
.
Some
furs
,
flung
together
in
separate
heaps
,
were
evidently
their
beds
;
two
long
rifles
standing
in
a
corner
,
and
a
few
trifles
scattered
carelessly
about
;
this
was
all
the
feeble
glimmer
could
reveal
.
The
men's
faces
were
strangely
alike
,
and
yet
,
in
another
sense
,
strangely
dissimilar
:
their
features
might
have
been
cast
in
the
same
mould
,
but
the
expression
of
each
face
was
totally
different
.
He
who
appeared
to
be
rather
the
younger
of
the
two
-
though
their
stature
agreed
,
and
it
was
not
by
that
means
one
distinguished
any
variation
—
was
leaning
forward
,
supporting
his
face
with
his
hands
,
and
gazing
with
a
look
of
settled
despair
,
indicating
thoughts
of
an
unenviable
past
,
into
the
feeble
remains
of
the
fire
.
Now
and
then
his
lips
moved
,
and
a
feeble
smile
played
upon
them
,
soon
to
vanish
,
as
if
chased
away
by
darker
broodings
,
and
to
be
succeeded
by
the
former
expression
of
hopelessness
.
His
companion
appeared
to
be
steadily
watching
him
through
half
-
closed
eyes
,
in
which
shone
a
restless
,
anxious
light
,
contrasting
markedly
with
the
other's
almost
sullen
look
.
A
nervousness
beyond
his
control
seemed
to
have
taken
complete
possession
of
him
,
and
showed
itself
by
the
frequent
changes
of
position
,
and
restless
movements
of
limbs
.
The
one
act
to
which
he
remained
constant
was
the
watch
upon
his
companion
,
and
in
whose
slightest
motion
he
betrayed
a
keen
interest
.
The
hours
passed
slowly
on
;
but
,
as
if
unheedful
,
or
perhaps
unconscious
of
the
flight
of
time
,
the
two
men
maintained
their
positions
unmoved
.
The
only
disturbing
sound
outside
was
the
dull
roar
.
of
the
icy
wind
as
it
shook
the
tops
of
the
pine
trees
,
and
passed
on
through
the
forest
.
Within
the
hut
perfect
silence
reigned
,

when

His
mate
flung
another
log
upon

embers
,
but
continued
his
watch
.
After
a
short
time
,
when
its
object
showed
all
the
signs
of

,
the
other
arose
and
,
moving

,
EXTRAORDINARY
CONFESSION
OF
THE
CRIMINAL
This
morning
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
James
Dalton
,
under
sentence
of
death
for
the
murder
of
Robert
Harrison
,
policeman
,
suffered
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
at
the
borough
gaol
.
"
After
giving
details
of
the
execution
,
the
reporter
proceeded
to
dilate
upon
the
last
confession
of
the
criminal
,
as
follows
:
"
About
six
o'clock
,
Dalton
,
who
appeared
calm
and
resigned
,
pleaded
for
an
interview
with
the
governor
,
alleging
that
he
wished
to
make
confession
of
a
crime
committed
by
himself
,
for
which
,
he
had
reason
to
believe
,
some
innocent
person
had
been
suspected
.
Immediately
on
the
request
being
conveyed
to
the
governor
,
he
,
in
company
with
the
chaplain
,
and
attended
by
his
shorthand
clerk
,
proceeded
to
the
prisoner's
cell
,
and
received
this
confession
of
the
unhappy
.
man
,
given
verbatim
.
"
At
eight
o'clock
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
shall
pass
into

I
have
lived

life

me
that
even
now
,
if
I
confess
everything
and
repent
,
I

I
may
be
forgiven

That's
what
I
can't
